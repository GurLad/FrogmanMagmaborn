# Frogman Magmaborn
A rogue-like SRPG made in Unity. Currently in a very early (and unstable) beta version, with about 50% of the planned content. You shouldn't really play it yet.
## [Frog Forge](../../../FrogForge)
Frog Forge is the tool I made to edit game files (maps, conversations, classes...). You still need Unity to use it, as the game files are compiled into the build.

Like the game, this is also in an early beta version. Use it at your own risk.
