The source of the Guard's power (and Tormen, revised):
Instead of the alternate god & magic system (concept from another file), the Guards simply managed to enter Torment's realm and steal a few crystals (an ironic betrayal perhaps?). These gave them direct access to Torment's realm and, by extension, their power source. As the crystals are unbreakable, Torment could do nothing about that, and the Guard's used Torment's own power to seal them.
As time went by, the Guards started experimenting with them, eventually inventing the Clone Vats - turning their fight with Torment into a permanent standstill, with both sides having unlimited resources.
They eventually managed to channel the crystals' power individually, creating super-mages who had pretty much infinite magic capabilities (like the Liches). These are the Tormen - as using the crystals' power turns their skin to cyan.
The last area will essentially be a tour of the Guard's main facility, showing the Clone Vats, the crystals themselves etc. This should show parallels between the monsters and the Guards (especially since the Guards basically destroyed civilization whenever people rediscovered the Magma Emblems), to make the final choice more difficult.
The lead guard (aka other final boss) will use crystal-powered technology, and will probably be a "crystalpunk" cyborg/machine.

Conversation system, revised:
The current system is good enough for simple conversations, but is pretty bad for complex ones (ex. Level3FirstTime), with lots of copy-pastes and continutiy problems (mostly when characters die between the pre- and post-battle conversations). So here are two solutions, both based on a master-slave system:
1.	Add header/source files (like C) - headers will include only the requirements and if-s, while the source will have the actual conversation. This should be much cleaner, but also more annoying to use and maintain.
2.	Split the conversation into many "functions" - the base conversation will be the aftermentioned header with requirements and if-s, while the content will appear in named sections (functions) below it.
Example (for 2, but similar to 1):

prority:42
unique:T
~ # Requirements
roomNumber:2
~ # Demands
~ # Content
:if:hasCharacter:Firbell{
:call:Firbell
}
:elseIf:hasCharacter:Kresla{
:call:Kresla
}
:else{
:call:Xirveros
}
~ # Post-battle
Frogman: Whew! We survived!

# ==== Functions ====

# First time with Firbell
~ Firbell
Firbell: This is Xirveros.
# First time with Kresla
~ Kresla
Kresla: This is Xirveros.
# First time (both Firbell and Kresla are dead)
~ Xirveros
Xirveros: I am Xirveros.

On magic & emblems, revised:
As stated before, there are two forms of magic: by experiencing the same amount of pain that the magic would inflict, or using Torment's crystals. Monsters can't experience pain, thus can't use the first form of magic. Only the guards have crystals, however, so only Liches (dead Guard mages) can use it. The Guard boss of Part 2 is a mage with a Magma Emblem, making them the first Magmaborn mage.
The Emblems are essentially a way to link Torment to people - similar to crystals, except manmade. The wielder of the Emblem is directly contacted by Torment at all times, which usually tries to manipulate them to kill as many people as possible & themselves. Only if the wielder dies violently do they return as Magmaborn. Most people - Frogman, Xirveros, Xeplogi - were driven mad by it. Some - Firbell - knew to ignore Torment. Most of the others were somewhere in between.

Characters (parts 1 + 2):
My previous concept about characters is rather old by now, and doesn't include the new ones. This is supposed to be writing guide for me up to level 8. Characters are written in chronological order.

-Xirveros:
 Wise, incomprehensible and mad. Xirveros was Torment's first champion, who tried to betray them near the end (the same way that Frogman does in one of the endings) and his mind was broken because of that.
 -Xirveros was driven mad way back when he was still alive, constantly plagued by Torment's manipulations. He developed some habits to counter that - composing shot songs to remember important information, omitting words to talk more easily, etc.
 -Once he was Reborn, he became sane again for a short time, and serving as Torment's first champion, secretly planning to undermine them in revenge for what they did. Firbell met him for short while during that time, but he kept her out of the fight.
 -After his mind was broken, his mad habits returned, but half of the time he speaks nonsense, which is hard to differentiate from important information.
-Firbell:
 Regal, authoritative and just. She is in a deep state of denial, and tries to mimic her real life behavior even if it doesn't make sense.
 -Died protecting her mother the queen during the grand coup. She believes that her sacrifice saved the kingdom and royal family, even though they were killed & forgotten centuries before the game.
 -Since the Guards cleansed the kingdoms and everyone forgot about them, no one can confirm that her kingdom is truly dead, so she continues believing that against all the odds.
 -Even though she was taught to never listen to Torment (after Irenhold's experience with Xirveros), she developed some violent tendencies due to their influence.
-Alfred:
 Unlikeable, rude and awkward. The kind of person you'd hate spending 5 minutes with, let alone eternity.
 -Stole his Magma Emblem from someone during the Guard rule following the destruction of the kingdoms, only to be accidently killed shortly after during the pursuit. This makes him the only Magmaborn who met the Guards before he died.
 -Was a common thief during the darkest age of humanity, so he never learned manners or civilized human interaction.
 -Most characters hate him, but he continues following them (and Frogman) nevertheless.
-Memerian (Golem):
 Stoic, stubborn and calm. She was Torment's second champion, who eventually grew tired of them and refused to help, tattooing information on her body to prevent them from erasing her memory.
 -She used to be a simple blacksmith, until she discovered and made Magma Emblems. She made three: one for herself, one she sold to Xeplogi and the last one she kept hidden (the Guards eventually recovered it).
 -After Xeplogi killed her, she was furious and violent, but calmed down eventually, after seeing what happened to Xeplogi. She still fights the Guards, but not for Torment's sake, but for her own survival.
 -She continues to humor Xeplogi, pretending to be the evil villain he claims she is near him.
-Xeplogi:
 Loud, narcissistic and has an inferiority complex. He used to be an actor, until buying the "Legendary Emblem" from Memerian, who convinced him that he was a mighty immortal hero sent to vanquish evil, only to be cursed by Memerian to turn into a monster.
 -Since he used to be an actor and currently has delusions of grandeur, tends to be overly dramatic and loud. Hates it when people ignore him.
 -He is absolutely certain of the story Torment told him when he was still alive, and refuses to listen to reason. Only follows Frogman because he deems the Guards even more evil.
 -Obsessed with Memerian, as he thinks that by defeating her enough time, he'll be rid of his "curse" and return to be the legendary hero.
-Kresla:
 Curious, fearless and obsessive. Her life's goal was to discover the secret of the Magma Emblems. She eventually managed to make one, but her partner (a Guard agent sent to monitor her progress) betrayed her and tried to take the Emblem. Trusting the Emblem's power, she killed herself before her partner could take it.
 -She is relatively new (died only a few years/decades before Frogman), and almost everything fascinates her, which causes her to talk on and on about stuff.
 -Has zero patience for things she considers "boring", like fighting and normal monsters.
 -Her status as an immortal increased her fearlessness to borderline suicidal, causing her to suggest (and attempt) all manners of crazy ideas.
-Frogman:
 Silent, sarcastic and impulsive. Torment's influence drives him to always continue fighting.
 -After the Torment champion reveal (end of Part 2), becomes more secluded and quite, but continues fighting the Guards despite himself.
 -Before he died, he killed his entire village and then himself, because he was driven mad by Torment. Once Frogman remembers this, he rushes to Torment, enraged, only to have his memory wiped again.
 -All other Magmaborn have an "unexplainable" impulse to follow him, because he is Torment's champion.
-Unnamed Magmaborn guard:
 Carefree, aloof and confident. Was entrusted the mission of taking the one Magma Emblem the Guards had, infiltrating the Magmaborn's and leading them to the Guard leader, in order to draw Torment out and finally end the cycle of destruction.
 -They are one of the few "real people" among the Guards (aka not a clone), and thus always had a special status.
 -Eventually became one of the most promising soldier, then battle mage, in the current generation of Guards. This is the reason they were chosen for the important mission.
 -As they had a crystal when they were alive (as a mage), they are reborn as a lich, further reinforcing their superiority over even the other Magmaborn. They claim to be Guard traitors in order to hide their true mission.

Alfred, revised:
I'm keeping the previous version in case I change my mind, but turns out that writing an annoying character is annoying.
-Alfred:
 Edgy, dark and unlikable. The kind of person you'd hate spending 5 minutes with, let alone eternity.
 -He was a young member of the Resistance during the Guard rule following the destruction of the Kingdoms, but died in one of his first missions: stealing the one Magma Emblem the Guards had.
 -Everyone else who was sent with him on that mission died in front of his eyes, and due to the unchanging nature of being a Magmaborn, he never got over their deaths, and constantly seeks vengeance on the Guards.
 -Only Memerian & Xeplogi (and maybe future Part 3 characters) knew him before the game (as they were the only ones fighting Guards), but they mostly avoided each other until Frogman reunited them.

The endings:
There are two endings (maybe a hidden third one):
1. Frogman sides with Torment: in that ending, once Torment wins, the Guards are basically wiped out and Torment is free. In exchange, they return all Magmaborn to their human form, but they lose their immortality. Afterwards, the monsters break free of the underground Magma, and the constant battle between humans and monsters above ground commences anew. The ending slides are about how each Magmaborn adapts to the new reality (mostly fighting the monsters).
2. Frogman sides with the Guards: in that ending, Torment is fully annhilated. All their power fades - all crystal-powered tech (ex. the clone vats) stop working, and all monsters (including the Magmaborn) disintegrate. The Guards dissolve, and humanity continues on, unaware of Torment, magic and monsters. The ending slides are about how each Magmaborn died before the game (aka a short backstory).
3. Frogman runs away (hidden, not sure whether to even implement): all Magmaborn run away before the final battle can commence. They try living as monsters in the outside world, but most are killed and return to the Magma. Some - Frogman, maybe Kresla and Memerian - never die, and Torment eventually finds a new champion to continue the cycle. The ending slides are about how each character lives on as a monster until they die again.

On Xeplogi:
Xeplogi has one more gimmick - his mind is reset each time he is Born. This perserves his blind devotion to Torment ("Tori"), and serves as a way to annoy Frogman, as Xeplogi will keep repeating the same lines. Torment does this because they find it funny.


=============================================================================================================

Older (better formatted at my concept compilation file):

Story:
People who die are reborn as mindless monsters from the Magma. A group of people, the Guards, kills the monsters to prevent them from getting to the surface. However, a lucky few found a Magma Emblem: an emblem that, when worn, lets them keep their mind and identity when they return from the Magma (they still turn into monsters, however). Frogman is one of them. He finds a few other people with Magma Emblems and, together, they try to escape the other monsters, the Guards and the Magma. However, there is one other force in play: The Blue Fireball of Torment (TBFOT). A sinister blue fireball, he sows chaos in the underground, helping the Magma Emblemers by giving them powerful weapons, but at the same time torturing them by throwing monsters at them.
TBFOT is the final boss, as by escaping the underground, the Magma Emblemers accidently set it free as well.
Gameplay:
The game has three areas. Each run, there are three rooms in each area: 2 normal rooms, where you get a random character, and a boss room, where you (obviously) fight a boss. In addition, after each boss, there is a special TBFOT encounter, where you get a weapon. The first area has mostly monster enemies, and the boss is a random powerful monster. The second area has both monsters and Guards (who fight each other as well as you), and the boss is a certain Guard captain with a Magma Emblem (they eventually join you after you kill them the first time and they turn into a monster, and the boss becomes a random generic Guard captain). The third room is the Guard headquarters on the surface and has only Guard enemies. The boss there is a king/angel/legendary warrior, who fights you alone (think FE7 Red Dragon). Afterwards, TBFOT betrays you, and you have to fight his minions for 2 rooms before engaging the true final boss: TBFOT itself.
Mechanics:
-After each room, you choose one of three random possible level ups for each character. All level ups increase exactly three stats, and the probabilities are determined by character. Monsters auto-level to (target-1) level by fixed probability based levels, and one random level.
-Each weapon has an innate ability that all wielders of that weapon share.
-Classes only affect enemies (growth rates), and have no abilities.
-There is "perma-death", as in when a character dies, they leave you for the current run. The only thing saved between runs are weapons, which you get from TBFOT battles.
Game types:
When you create a new save, you choose three things:
-Mode:
--Roguelike: default, as described above
--Classic: FE-like. There are 12 chapters + TBFOT endgame, which are essentially handpicked rooms and conversations. True perma-deaths, and when Frogman dies, return to save.
--PvP: One player plays the Guards and the other monsters. Start at area 2, and whenever the Guards win move towards 1, and when the monsters win towards 3 (~2 wins for an area change). Only the surviving lord (random character) is saved between battles and levels up. The run ends when a side wins twice in their opponent's area, and a new game can then begin.
-RNG-system:
--RNG: default, 1.5RN for hits.
--Hybrid: 50% of using Luck system, 50% of 1.5RN. Luck is always between 0-99.
--Luck: Each character has a luck stat (starts at 50 each battle). Whenever they try to hit, increase it by the percent. If it's above 100, reduce it by 100 and the attack hits. Otherwise, it misses.
-Difficulty:
--Easy: Your units start with an extra level, enemies can't have skills (as in the innate ability that all wielders of a certain type of weapon share).
--Normal: Default, only enemy bosses have skills.
--Hard: Enemies start with an extra level, all enemies have skills (mainly annoying and has memory issues, so perhaps not).

Alternate combat system:
Replace Pierce with Skill, as Pierce might make defensive strategies unviable. If the attacker (check for them only) has higher skill than the target, they can't counter. Damage is just "Weapon power + user strength - target defense(/2 maybe)".

AI:
Overview of current and future AI types:
Each unit has their AI written in their status page. Each AI also has a priority.
I originally thought of some AI ideas a few weeks ago, but forgot to write it down, so I forgot most of my ideas by now.
-Monster (basic) AI:
--Charge:
  If there is no enemy in range, find the closest enemy, and find the quickest way to reach them. Otherwise, use Hold AI.
--Hold (pretty bad name):
  Don't move unless there is an enemy in range. If there is one, find the one who this unit deals the most damage to, and attack it
  from favorable terrain (if possible).
--Guard:
  Don't move. If there is an adjacent enemy, attack the one this unit deals the most damage to.
-Guard AI:
 Generally smarter and more team-based. Should use strategies such as flanking, baiting, holding choke points etc.
 This may require an AI overhaul, with a team-based AI function instead of unit-based one.
 Most AI types will be part of a group/under the same commander, who will always work together.
 I will write more options as I think of concrete algorithms to describe them.
--Group bait:
  Similar to hold, but only attack the enemy if at least X units can also attack it this turn. Otherwise, retreat to just outside the enemy's range.
--Group charge:
  Similar to charge, but all units in the group choose the same uni to attack, even if some of them end up in unfavorable terrain because of that
  or can't reach them in the same turn. Could also make it like Bait, where at least X units must be able to attack that unit.

Alternate Torment levels palette:
Torment, as a character, is mostly cyan-bright cyan. Since no team uses these colors, and with the, being th final boss, it's weird that they're red in-game.
In addition, the Guards boss and Torment should be able to appear at the same time, so using the Guard's palette is problematic.
Here are a couple of solutions, each with their own problems, sorted from easiest to implement to hardest.
1.  Use the Guard's palette:
    This technically has zero problems now, as the only Torment level contains zero guards, but will become very problematic in the future.
    Pros:
    -Zero coding or changes - simply change their team and the name during Torment levels (already done).
    -Most mechanics just work - all palette changing works as expected, and so will future mechanics.
    -No undesired changes - the game already assumes that the Guard palette exists, so it doesn't affect other graphics.
    Cons:
    -Can't have Torment and Guards in the same room - which is very problematic for the future.
    -No current Guard support - while I could hardcode a simple solution, it kind of removes the main advantage of this method - works immediately in the short term.
2.  Change the monsters palette color (current):
    Simply change the red colors in the PaletteController to cyan ones.
    Pros:
    -Minimal coding - only a few lines. Besides being quick & lazy, it keeps the code simple & clean with few hardcoded 'if's and such.
    -Most mechanics just work - all palette changing works as expected, and so will future mechanics.
    -Immediate guard support - as it doesn't affect them at all.
    Cons:
    -Lots of undesired changes - from changing stat colors to completely wrecking portraits, it ruins many details, without the charm of, say, Kirby's Adventure's palette swapping.
2a. Also change Torment's color:
    It has the same pros and cons from before, but changing red to yellow or pink for example will not be as bad.
3.  Create a complicated system that constantly shifts palettes:
    I rarely use all four palettes outside of the map, so constantly switching palettes depending on the needs of the moment will probably work.
    The only problematic place I can think of is having Player, Torment and Guard characters in the same room and a speaking character that uses the gray palette.
    Pros:
    -If done correctly, will solve all problems - no undesired changes and supports Guards.
    Cons:
    -Hard and complicated to implement - the only I can think of right now to do that is simply add tons of 'if's to lots of scripts.
    -Messes up the code - the above method will make the code unreadable, hard to maintain and easily breakable.

On the outside world:
Characters come from many different eras (and are mostly unaware of that). Here are some details about the world in different eras.
-Before recorded history:
 Torment was free, terrorizing the people with various monsters, and resurrecting the dead as more monsters. Eventually, a group of people managed to seal it.
 These were the ancestors of Marcus, the boss of Part 3. Magic was rampant during that era, directly related to Torment (see On Magic).
-Ancient Era (Xirveros, Firbell):
 The world was mostly divided into different kingdoms. Each kingdom was rules by a very traditional and zealous royal family.
 The kingdoms always fought each other in terrible wars, eventually ruining every single kingdom.
 Xirveros is from the beginning of this era, while Firbell was one of the last royals of Irenhold, one of the last three kingdoms.
 -Kingdoms (as of Firbell's time):
  -Abenzon:
   Abenzon was the largest kingdom. It mostly focused on commerce and peaceful negotiations. Secretly, it arranged to assassinate the royal families of the other kingdoms,
   blaming the other one each time, hoping it would lead them to destroy each other and allow Abenzon to rule the world.
  -Irenhold:
   Irenhold was the oldest surviving kingdom, being there from the very beginning of recorded history. It mostly focused on science and military. Incredibly arrogant, the
   royals of Irenhold considered themselves better than the other kingdoms, even when their own kingdom was on the verge of collapse.
   The night Firbell died, most of the Irenhold royals were assassinated in a coup arranged by Abenzon. Firbell obviously is unaware, as she was the only one with a
   Magma Emblem: Irenhold's national treasure, gifted to her by her mother the queen, Kirmella, once she came of age (Firbell was the heir to the kingdom).
   Xirveros also originated from Irenhold (as you can see from his name), about 100 years before Firbell was born, and originally created the Magma Emblems.
   Only two were ever made - one for him and another was gifted to Irenhold's royal family - and the secret of making them was thought lost throughout the Ancient Era.
  -Enkeros:
   Enkeros was the smallest kingdom, uninterested in outside politics, and mostly focused on art and culture. After the assassination of Irenhold's royal family,
   Enkeros surprised Abenzon by launching a surprise attack on it along with the remaining royals of Irenhold. They managed to destroy Abenzon, but shortly after
   attacked each other, and the remaining royals were killed by an uprising of the starving citizens who were tired of the constant wars.
 -Naming:
  People had only a first name, along with a descriptor of their origin kingdom.
  For example, Bob from Irenhold would be called Irbob, and Tim from Abenzon would be called Abtim.
  Royal or important people also had a title before their name, signifying their importance/royal blood.
  For example, princess Bell from Irenhold would be called F-Ir-Bell, aka Firbell. King Roy of Enkeros would be called K-En-Roy, aka Kenroy.
  Titles (that are used in Frogman Gaiden):
  -X: An honorific title given to important non-royals (like war heroes, scientists, artists ec.) by royals (ex. Xirveros).
  -M: A member of the royal family, but without an official title (siblings of the king, and all princes/princesses besides the heir).
  -F: The current heir to the throne (ex. Firbell).
  -K: The current king/queen (ex. Kirmella).
-Some more eras TBA
-Modern Era (Kresla):
 Start of an industrial resolution-like age. No gunpowder yet, but early signs of modern science (as much as it's possible in a fantasy world)
 and early steam-based machines. The Ancient Era was all but forgotten, but some remnants are still present - for example, many common names begin with K, like Kresla,
 as these are still remembered as king's/queen's names.

On Magic:
Magic is essentially the act of becoming an extension of Torment: the source of all magic. Magic is necessarily destructive, and inflicts the same amount of pain on
the wielder as it would cause. Therefore, it's used mostly as a weapon, and an inefficient one at that. While Torment was free, it was pretty much the only weapon
available to humanity (Torment feeds on the pain of their minions as well as the caster), so it was used extensively. Over time, as more efficient weapons were made,
magic lost its use, eventually being all but forgotten.
Xirveros is from a time when wizards still existed, and was the only wizard who managed to find a non-destructive use for it (although still a pain-inducing one).
It could be the reason he went mad (experiencing the pain of all Magma Emblemers).

Story, expanded:
-Part 1: Monsters (name not final)
 Not much happens besides what's already in-game: Player discovers Firbell, Xirveros and Kresla; Finds the first boss (Lich); and discovers Torment.
-Part 2: Monsters & Guards (see above)
 First two levels: Introductions to the Guards, fighting both monsters and Guards at the same time.
 Level 3: The boss is a living Guard with a Magma Emblem. Once the player defeats them, they can be recruited in Part 3 as a monster (the player chooses whether to
 help them or not). Afterwards, it becomes random generic Guard captains.
 Level 4: Another Torment battle. They tell the player that they are sealed, and should the player free them, they will let Frogman and co. go.
-Part 3: Guards (see above)
 First two levels: Incredibly difficult battles, against the most elite Guards there are. The last 3 playable characters are extremely powerful as well (one is a Lich,
 another is Part 2's boss as a monster, and one more), as they have little to no customization.
 Level 3: Here the player fights the other final boss & main antagonist: Marcus Marcus (maybe change the family name, but I like it). This is a solo battle against him,
 a FE7 Red Dragon-esque finale. Once the player defeats Marcus, Torment shows up and asks Frogman to finish Marcus, and in return Torment will let them go. Should the
 player agree, Torment will betray them after Marcus dies (Cyan will betray you~) and kill them, followed by their return to the world and destructon of humanity.
 Should the player refuse, they will fight Torment itself (and their minions of course), in the true final battle. Once the player wins, they have the choice of sparing
 Torment. Should they spare them, Torment will do what they agreed at the start, letting Frogman and co. return to the world (as monsters), while Torment remains sealed.
 Should the player decide to kill them, Torment will fight again (pathetically weak this time), and once killed, Marcus will intervene and lay the final blow. This will
 cause Torment to truly die, all magic and monsters disappear, and all the Magma Emblemers immediatly die forever.

Knowledge:
Knowledge should make the game more interesting as time goes by, not simply easier. Good knowledge upgrades give players more choices/strategies. Bad ones increase stats.
Currently, knowledge effects are hardcoded (may change that in the future, although may be too complicated).
Sample knowledge upgrades (pretty much ToDo):
 -Increase the amount of available level-ups (start at 1/2, upgrade to 3).
 -Inclination offensive buff (unavailable at first).
 -Change Frogman's inclination.
 -Change X's inclination (requires an event with X to unlock).
 -Offering to Torment - your units take 1 damage after each turn in Torment levels, but Torment minions have -1 levels.
 -Deny Torment - your units heal 1 HP after each turn in Torment levels, but Torment minions have +1 levels.
 
On the writing:
I'm rather unhappy with the current texts: they're too silly and boring. In order to improve their quality and in preparations for a complete rewrite, I'm writing here
some notes about the characters and general tone.
-General:
 -Make the script less silly. It's not a very serious game and a joke here and there is good, but I overdid it a bit (see Xirveros).
 -Make conversations shorter. The naming system is cool, but only mention it once and as a side note.
 -Less info dumps. They're boring.
-Frogman:
 -I'm pretty happy with him. A nice "silent" protagonist, a bit silly and sarcastic. Hides his memories later on when they return and becomes much more stiff then.
-Firbell:
 -Is rather boring currently. Here are the three most important qualities in my opinion:
  -She is a secluded princess who died relatively young, and as such, speaks like a royal and is aloof at times. She always acts like a "perfect princess",
   but that's the boring effect...
  -...as she's always in a deep state of denial. In order to stay sane in the hundreds of years with no human interaction (except the mad Xirveros), she convinced herself
   that her current state is only temporary, that one day Irenhold will find a way to cure her and accept her as queen. She keeps acting like a princess because, in her mind,
   she still is one.
  -Lastly, she also has subtler tendencies for violence and pain. Not really a psychopath/sociopath, but a violent person nonetheless. She tries very hard to hide those
   tendencies, but they should show through at times.
 -Should be much more interesting once the Guards, and the moral dilemma associated with them, is introduced. Becomes the (flawed) "moral compass" of the group.
 -This is also the reason she never ventured too far before Frogman arrived, and it should be mentioned.
-Xirveros:
 -Needs a complete rewrite. He's mad and talks nonsense, but shouldn't be a comic-relief character. Think Trigvy from Banner Saga.
 -The songs are great (a way for him to memorise important details; unfortunately, he began memorising nonsense as well), but a bit overdone currently (they should be rare).
 -As for his madness:
  -Most of the time, he should just say random nonsense (Magma tastes like tea~).
  -Other times, he should hint about the past (ask where his friends are, the king, etc.). Many references to his prequal story (TBA).
  -Rarely, he will talk about important (and sometimes future) plot details. He's the only one who can remember Torment, and some songs (The truth with you shall die~) are
   direct "spoilers" for the future.
  -He should NOT act like a child/animal/lunatic. No climbing on frogs (I really regret ever writing that conversation).
 -Sometimes, simply writhes in pain.
-Kresla:
 -There are multiple aspects to her story and personality, and is the character whose current iteration matches my ideas the most. Still, these should be evident:
  -At heart, she's incredibly curious. Everything new excites here, and she tends to go on and on about practically anything.
  -She's also bored relatively quickly. While she's the "youngest" Emblemer before Frogman, she's already bored of the monsters. This will come up in repeat conversations.
  -Lastly, she's a masochist - after all, she did suicide just to see how Magma Emblems work. This should come across as being completely fearless, and accepting any
   pain-inducing suggestion.

On Tormen:
While Torment was free, they sometimes granted people who inflicted a great deal of pain (both on humans and monsters) their "blessing", changing their skin color to blue.
When Torment was sealed, the Tormen survived, and continued existing throught all the different eras. They were treated differently in each one: sometimes as champions,
other times as monsters, but most of the time as people. A few characters should comment about their conflicting beliefs about Tormen.
The true reason they exist: human portraits can either have RGB color of hair. I chose hair. But to prevent them from seeming "pure Anime", I wanted some humans to have
normal hair color with an RGB skin color. Pure white seemed a bit weird and racist, so I chose blue and added story relevance.
(Canceled)

On repeat maps:
Creating even 10 maps for each level could be tedious, but I aim for the game to take 10-15 runs to complete. While artificially increasing game length is a bad practice,
I still want to add more conversations. So here are a few ideas:
-Reduce repeats: save whenever a player finishes a map. Once they do, that map won't appear again until all other maps have been finished.
-Prevent true repeats, by doing one of the following:
--If a player is forced to repeat a map, replace all monsters with random ones of the same type (normal, flier, boss).
--Once a player finished all maps for a level, add a knowledge upgrade to skip that level. This requires all maps to have the same amount of variations (otherwise, it would
  be too weird.).
--Once a player finished all maps for a level, always/if they have the knowledge, replace the level with a small "base", with optional supports (maybe even
  Gaiden-style exploration).
