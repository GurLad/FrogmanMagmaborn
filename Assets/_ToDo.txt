 -Move all room logic to MapController.

V-Add room events:
 V-Each room has an event that plays after the normal conversation (most rooms still have no event). This is mostly for changing enemy AI mid-battle.
 V-Add relevant requirements & commands:
  ~-frogmanPoxX, frogmanPosY, numUnitsInTeam
  V-setTeamAI:Guard:Charge

?-Fix AI for 2 range units:
  -Fix find closest unit
  -Fix find which unit to attack
  -Fix find where to attack from

 -More Knowledge upgrades:
 V-Rework Knowledge menu: Seperate into categories.
 V-Vengeance: Frogman gains an extra stat each level-up for each dead unit (obviously unavailable on Medium)
 V-Eternal Torment: Heal 1/2 HP after each turn, but monsters & Torment units gain an extra level (high risk-high reward)
  -Clear level X: Skip/replace with camp whenever you reach level X. See "On repeat maps" in Concept. (Edit: seems pointless - simply add more maps)

 -Show range on hover
 -Mouse controls
~-Add show more info on stat screen (like FEGBA R button) (currently a very lazy implementation)
~-Improve tutorial (add another unit, how to view stats and show danger area) (currently a very lazy implementation)
 -Add Inclination tutorial/explaination.
V-Add movement animations (I've been delaying this for so long, I completely forgot about it)
 -Add undo last move (if didn't attack)
~-Show how many units are left to move in the end turn message (currently a very lazy implementation)
V-Add game over screen
 -Add options menu, with:
 V-Resolution and controls
 V-Battle animation mode (Original, Fast (default) and Map)
  -View past tutorials
~-Add what happens to events the player didn't finish (probably a setFlag in the pre-battle part, and if that skips it if the flag)
~-Find a way to make early levels less boring (probably simply add more maps) (added more maps)
 -First Kresla level is too hard
 -Still a bit too hard apperantly
V-Fix turn phase animation
 -Fix too long text being hidden by the arrow
~-Improve/replace music
