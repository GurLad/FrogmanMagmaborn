Torment|???: Welcome, welcome!\a This is Frogman Magmaborn!
Frogman: Huh? Who are you?
Torment|???: I am... uh...\a Tori! Yes, Tori! Heh!\a I will teach you how to play!
Frogman: Play? What are you talking about?!
Torment|Tori: I'm not talking to you, Frogman, but to YOU!\a Yes, you! In front of the screen!
Frogman: What?!
Torment|Tori: Oh, shut up already!\a Anyway, you play all the green units,\a like Frogman here.
Torment|Tori|L: Try selecting him by pressing [AButton].
:tutorialShowMarker:5,4
:tutorialForceButton:A:5,4:-2
Torment|Tori|L: Excellent! You see those green squares?\a Those are places Frogman can move to.
Frogman: Do I have a say in this?
Torment|Tori: Of course not! Ha ha!
Frogman: Well, I refuse to move for you!
Torment|Tori: Oh, really? Let's see you try that!
Torment|Tori|L: Move away from the goblin.
:tutorialShowMarker:4,6
:tutorialForceButton:A:4,6:-2
Frogman||R: Ahhh!
Torment|Tori: Ha ha ha! What a fool! As if you are free...
But running away is no solution!\a You must fight your enemies!
Frogman: Why are they my enemies?
Torment|Tori: I'm not going to spoil the story here...\a But it's not like you have a choice! Heh!
Torment|Tori|L: Start by undoing your last move with [BButton].
:tutorialForceButton:B
Torment|Tori|L: Excellent! Now move near the goblin!
:tutorialShowMarker:8,6
:tutorialForceButton:A:8,6:-2
Frogman||R: But I like goblins!
Torment|Tori: Then you're an even bigger fool! Heh heh!\a Anyway, where were we? Ah, right.\a Do you see those gray squares?\a These are places you can attack!\a The red characters are your enemies -\a you must kill them all!\a At least, most of the time. Heh.
Frogman: What squares? And I don't want to fight!
Torment|Tori: How many times do I need to tell you?\a I'm not talking to you, Frogman!
Torment|Tori|L: *sigh* Just attack this Goblin now.
:tutorialShowMarker:8,8
:tutorialForceButton:A:8,8:-2
Torment|Tori: Yes! YES! Bring the PAIN!\a Um, I mean, you are great at following orders!
Frogman: Thank you...\a As if I have a choice...
Torment|Tori: Stop that! Anyway, the Goblin will now attack you.\a Good luck!
Frogman: What?!
:wait:!unitAlive:Goblin
Torment|Tori: Wow! Incredible! Sublime! Excellent!\a You slew this Goblin with amazing skill!
Frogman: But now I'm hurt!
Torment|Tori: Oh, get over it. You can't heal anyway.
Frogman: What?!\a I'm doomed to stay injured forever?!
Torment|Tori: Yes! Heh! This is how this game works!\a At least, until you finish the level...\a Or get a certain ability...
Frogman: You keep saying nonsense!
Torment|Tori: Well, that was the tutorial!\a It's pretty basic, but you should be able to figure out\a the rest.
Try pressing [BButton] on units to view their info,\a or [StartButton] to pause.
Frogman: Who are you talking to?!
Torment|Tori: Right, I should probably wipe Frogman's memory before you\a begin.
Frogman: Stop ignoring me!
Torment|Tori: And... Done!
Frogman: Where am I? Who are you?
Torment|???: Ha ha ha!\a Goodbye, and good luck!\a Have fun!
