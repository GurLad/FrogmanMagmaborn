FrogmanMan: Hey.
Dehar: Hiya. I assume you've heard about me.
FrogmanMan: Half the port did, thanks to Menross.
You have around half an hour before you're arrested,\a I'd say.
Dehar: Heh. I know ma stuff. They'd never catch me, no sir!
FrogmanMan: Listen, I don't know what's your deal,\a but you're no smuggler.\a Nevertheless, I need a ship. Do you have one?
Dehar: The fastest there is this side of tha sea.\a And I'm tha best smuggler ya'll ever meet!
FrogmanMan: Right. How much for it?
Dehar: Where do ya need?
FrogmanMan: Enkress.
Dehar: That's a long journey. For provisions, quarters, crew-
FrogmanMan: No crew. And I don't need the details.\a Just the cost.
Dehar: ...Ya're serious, aren't ya?\a Fine. Fifty gold.
FrogmanMan: No way. Thirty.
Dehar: Listen. I know desperation when I see it.\a Fifty, or I'm out. And I guess ya too.
FrogmanMan: ...Fine. Here.
Dehar: ...
Ya're one rich thief, aren't ya?\a Well, no time to lose.\a Follow me!
FrogmanMan: ...This might've been a mistake.
