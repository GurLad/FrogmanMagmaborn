Torment: Hello there, Frogman.
Frogman: Ahh! What are you doing here?!
Torment: I'm everywhere! Ha ha!\a Anyway, I couldn't help but notice\a that you appear to have some... difficulties.\a Heh.
Frogman: ...
Torment: As fun as it is to watch you fail over and over again,\a how about we spice things up, eh?
Frogman: What are you talking about?
Torment: Show some patience, please. Ha!\a As I was saying...
I still have some power here.\a You will know it soon enough... Heh heh.
