Ya can come out now, I reckon.
FrogmanMan: Ugh, finally. It felt like I was down there for hours!
Dehar: That's because ya were, plumcot.
FrogmanMan: What?! But you said it'll only be for a few minutes!\a Just until we left that port!
Dehar: I was wondering how long ya'll stay there.\a Didn't think ya'd truly wait for my signal.
FrogmanMan: Why, you-
Dehar: Hey, easy now! It was just a little prank!
FrogmanMan: I-
Dehar: Tell ya what. Let me make up for that.\a Here, ya can have this ring.
FrogmanMan: Huh? Why would I want a ring?
Dehar: I think it'll look good on ya.
FrogmanMan: I don't really-
Dehar: Please? Just try it on, will ya?
FrogmanMan: I... Ugh, whatever. Give it to me.\a Here.\a Happy now?
:play:Silence
Dehar: ...You're very trusting, Frogman.\a That's a useful quality.
FrogmanMan: Huh?
Dehar: Not very bright, either. Yes, you'll do just fine.
FrogmanMan: What is going on?\a Wait, the ring-
:play:Trustworthy
TormentFB: You don't want to do that, Frogman.\a Take off that ring now, and you'll die. Heh heh.
FrogmanMan: What?! Who is talking? Where are you?!
TormentFB: I'm not here, Frogman. Heh.\a I'm just talking to you through that ring.
FrogmanMan: How is this even-

Urk!

Dehar||L: Thank you for distracting him, Torment.
TormentFB: No problem, Fashima. It's always fun working with you.\a Ha ha ha!
Dehar|||F: Likewise. Shall we go, then?
:darkenScreen:T
TormentFB|||F: What about our friend here?
Dehar|||F: What about- Wait, why is his body still here?
TormentFB|||F: He's not quite dead yet, Fashima.\a Have you lost your touch, perhaps? Heh heh.
:darkenScreen:T
Dehar|||F: Ugh. If you knew he was still alive,\a why did you blow my cover?
TormentFB|||F: Don't worry, Fashima. He'll forget everything, any-
# Fashima actually kills Frogman

:hideCG:
Frogman: Ah! Fashima... is working with Torment?\a And she's the one who killed me?!\a Wait... was she also the one who killed Zip?!\a And I've... Oh, I've been such a fool!\a I will show them!\a I will stop them!\a For Zip!
:play:Trustworthy
Torment: My, what a dramatic speech! Ha ha ha!
Frogman: Torment! Why, you will pay for this! For everything!
Torment: Ha! Do you truly think you can betray me now?
Frogman: You killed me, Torment! You and Fashima!\a Of course I'll no longer work with you!
Torment: Heh heh. So much passion.\a Too bad you'll forget all of this.
Frogman: What are you-
:screenShake:
Oof!
