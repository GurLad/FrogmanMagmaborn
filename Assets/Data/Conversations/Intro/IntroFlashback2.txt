Zip: Frogman. She's coming.
FrogmanMan: Already? Oh well, nothing to be done about it.\a Let her in.
Zip: I don't like it, Frogman. She smells fishy.\a And not the tasty kind.
FrogmanMan: She's alone and foreign.\a There's not much she can do to us.\a Besides, we can't be seen to be afraid of her.\a It would harm our reputation.
Zip: Your reputation, you mean.
FrogmanMan: I know you despise this stuff, but it protects us. I mean,\a who would want to mess with the legendary Frogman?
Zip: All the people who want to kill you now?\a Like her?
FBWitness||L: *knock*

FrogmanMan: We're out of time, Zip. Just let her in, please.\a I'll deal with her.
Zip: ...\a You're the boss, boss.\a I'll let her in.
Kebera||L: Hello, Frogman. Thank you for having an audience with me.
FrogmanMan: Greetings, Kebera. Please, have a seat.
Kebera: Thank you.
FrogmanMan: This is my colleague, Zip.
Zip||R: ...
FrogmanMan||R: I hope you do not mind having him here.\a Treat him as my shadow.
Kebera: I see.
FrogmanMan: So. Let's get to business. What do you want?
Kebera: Let me start from the beginning. My name is-
FrogmanMan: I know who you are. Your request?
Kebera: I'll be blunt then.
I was sent here on behalf of the governor of Straberod.\a She offers you a mission.
FrogmanMan: In the middle of the war?
Kebera: Yes. The mission is quite vital for it.
FrogmanMan: I don't care much for Straberod, but let's hear it.
Kebera: Unfortunately, I cannot disclose it to anyone but you,\a Frogman.\a Those are my instructions.
FrogmanMan: Unacceptable. Zip will hear everything I will.
Kebera: She is willing to pay quite handsomely for this, Frogman.
FrogmanMan: I don't care. It's both of us, or nothing.
Kebera: ...Is there any way to change your mind?
FrogmanMan: No.\a If that is all, I think we're done here.\a Zip, show her out.
Kebera: There is no need, Frogman.\a Thank you for your hospitality.
Zip||L: ...
I told you she's trouble.
FrogmanMan: You were right. She was testing us.\a Me.\a Let's tail her. Ready to go?
Zip: Always.
