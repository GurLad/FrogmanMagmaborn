Frogman: Urgh... My head...\a Wait... I remember... something?

FrogmanMan||L: Whew, we're safe.
Zip: At last... That was quite a run, boss.
FrogmanMan: I know, but we've finally lost them.
Zip: I still don't know how you do it, boss.
FrogmanMan: Which part? Infiltrating the most well-guarded castle in\a the region, stealing all the valuables,\a or getting away with it?
Zip: Ha! Ever the humble one, eh?
FrogmanMan: Heh. Well, enough with the pleasantries.\a Status report.
Zip: Let me see...\a We have seven silver plates, thirteen forks-
FrogmanMan: Skip the trinkets for now. Highlights?
Zip: Right. Three Abezy paintings.
FrogmanMan: Abezy? Where did the lord get them?
Zip: Don't know, boss.\a They seem pretty new, however.
FrogmanMan: They're probably fake then.\a Next?
Zip: Uh... There's the diamond necklace we found.
FrogmanMan: Right, that one. It will be hard finding a buyer,\a but it's worth it.
Zip: Probably. What else... Ah, the muskets.
FrogmanMan: We never found the gunpowder and bullets, did we?
Zip: No, boss. Frankly, I don't think he had any.
Probably only kept them to impress guests.
FrogmanMan: Yes. Too bad. They're useless then.
Zip: We might find someone willing-
FrogmanMan: Too risky.\a Well, it's still a good haul.\a Let's go back.
Zip: Sure thing, boss.
