FrogmanMan||L: Huff... This should be... far enough...
Zip: Ha... Ha... Tired already... old man?
FrogmanMan: Ha! This is... nothing...
Zip: Heh.\a Well, I think we're safe. Let's rest a bit, eh?
FrogmanMan: Yeah.\a But first, what's our status?
Zip: Oh, give me a break!
FrogmanMan: ...
Zip: Fine, fine. Well, let me see.\a We infiltrated a well-guarded castle,\a stole a lot of valuables,\a and managed to get away undetected.\a Almost.
FrogmanMan: Yeah... Those pesky dogs...\a Well, at least we managed to get away.\a But I meant the valuables - what have we got?
Zip: Let me see... Some jewellery, plates, a small frog idol...\a You want it for yourself, don't you, Frogman?
FrogmanMan: You can keep it, thanks.\a What else?
Zip: Uh... Two muskets, but no powder or bullets.
FrogmanMan: Ah. We should probably hide them here then.\a They would draw too much attention.
Zip: Yeah. Too bad. I would've loved to see one in action.
FrogmanMan: If the rumours about the war in Straberod are true,\a you probably don't want that.
Zip: I know, I know. Still,\a throwing these away is a shame. Oh well.\a Let's catch some shuteye, eh?
FrogmanMan: Yes. It was quite the day...
