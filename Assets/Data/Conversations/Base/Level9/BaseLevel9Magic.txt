Frogman: Can you tell me more about magic?
Fashima: What do you wish to know, my friend?
Frogman: Uh, maybe what are the limitations of magic?
With the amount of it going around here,\a it appears as if it can do anything.
Fashima: Magic can only affect living creatures.
This means that magic can't be used to set a tree on fire,\a or to open a chasm in the ground.\a In addition, physical contact with the target is required.
Frogman: Physical contact?
Fashima: Touching the skin - or equivalent - of the target.\a Some materials can also serve as conductors, like my staff,\a which allow you to hold it more comfortably.
Usually, the target will be the mage itself. Therefore,\a most spells resolve around self-enhancement -\a increased speed or strength,\a illusions around the target,\a teleportation,\a and transformation.
Frogman: Wow. But I remember the lich attacking us by touching us\a with it's crystal -\a what kind of spell is that?
Fashima: That is the simplest spell in existence, my friend:\a inflicting pain.\a The source of all magic - and all crystals -\a is Torment.
The original purpose of the crystals was to inflict pain,\a and only powerful wizards can use them for other spells.\a That is why magic has always been rare,\a even during periods where crystals were common.
Frogman: I... see. And can you cast spells remotely?\a Like with your teleportation crystals?
Fashima: No. You can only cast a spell by touching the crystal.\a However, you can enchant a crystal to contain a\a conditional spell,
which will be automatically cast on whoever touches it.\a These spells are much more difficult to execute, though.
Frogman: Oh.\a And how do Magma Emblems fit into all of this?
Fashima: Since crystals are a direct connection to Torment,
some wizards have found a way to communicate with them.
Once a living wizard approaches Torment,
Torment will usually teach them how to make Magma Emblems\a - an incredibly complex spell designed by Torment,
with the purpose of turning people into their champions,\a and ultimately escaping this place.\a As far as I know,
only three people have managed to create Magma Emblems -\a Xirveros, The Boss, and Memerian.
Frogman: The Boss?
Fashima: ...I've unfortunately never found out his true name.\a Nevertheless, he is irrelevant and long dead by now.
Frogman: Dead?
Fashima: I do not wish to speak about him, my friend.\a Now, do you have any further questions?
