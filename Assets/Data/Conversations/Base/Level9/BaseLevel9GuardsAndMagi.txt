Frogman: So... You used to be a Guard mage, right?
}
Fashima: No. I used to be a Magus, not a Guard.\a The Guards are a completely different thing.
Frogman: What's the difference?
Fashima: Guards are simple-minded clones, created using magic.\a The Magi are humans,\a trained to use magic and lead the Guards.
Frogman: Wait. Clones?
Fashima: Yes. They are quite similar to the monsters created by\a Torment.\a Both are mere minions of the actual powers here -\a the Magi and Torment themselves.
Frogman: You know Torment?!
Fashima: Obviously. All Magi know that they exist.
Frogman: How?
Fashima: The original eight champions were the ones who sealed\a Torment in the first place.\a These champions also founded the Magi and Guards,
for the sole purpose of keeping Torment -\a and their monsters - sealed,\a and as far from humanity as possible.
Frogman: Oh.
