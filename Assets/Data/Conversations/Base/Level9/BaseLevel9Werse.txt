Frogman: Could you tell me more about Werse?\a Their surrender was... unexpected.
Fashima: It had surprised me as well.
I appear to have underestimated them.
Frogman: You mean Werse?
Fashima: Yes.
I didn't get to know them much during my time as a Magus -\a they tended to deflect my questions.
I assumed it was merely a general dislike towards me,\a but it appears they have an agenda of their own.
Frogman: And what would that be?
Fashima: I do not know, unfortunately.\a Yet they clearly possess great magical capabilities.
Frogman: Greater than yours?
Fashima: I deem that unlikely.
They are the second-youngest Magus alive.
They couldn't possibly have had the time to surpass me.
Frogman: I see...
Fashima: Still, they could be quite dangerous.\a They are not to be trusted.
Frogman: Unlike you?
Fashima: Yes. I can assure you, my friend,\a that I am quite trustworthy.
Frogman: Yeah...
