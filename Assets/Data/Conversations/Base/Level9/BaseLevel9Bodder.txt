Frogman: What's the deal with Bodder? He was eccentric,\a even for a Magus.\a No offense intended.
Fashima: Bodder has lived most of his life in isolation,\a alongside the newly cloned Guards.\a His entire job is to train them,\a and instill in them the will to defend humanity,\a at all costs.\a I believe some of that has gone to his head.
Frogman: That's for sure. But he's also quite powerful.
Fashima: Indeed. Bodder has perfected all forms of magic related to\a physical enhancement.\a Fortunately, he is quite predictable,\a and not too careful.\a Should you learn his pattern and defeat his...\a "Super Mega Uber Form",\a as he likes to call it,\a he would surely perish.
Frogman: Do you have any advice for that?
Fashima: He is quite vulnerable to attacks from afar.
And pay close attention to the colour of his eyes.
They change depending on the fighting style he chooses.
Frogman: I see. Thanks.
Fashima: Anything for you, my friend.
