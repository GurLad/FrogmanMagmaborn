Frogman: Why did you kill Alfred?
Fashima: None of your buisness.
Frogman: Excuse me?
You've killed one of my companions for no reason!\a That is very much my buisness!
Fashima: It is not.
What is between Alfred and myself does not concern you.\a Now, do you have any further questions, my friend?
Frogman: Not before you answer that one!
Fashima: ...Let me rephrase that in a way even a simpleton like you\a can understand.\a Cease asking me about Alfred,\a or I shall slay you as well. Understood?
Frogman: But.. why? What has he done to you?
:screenShake:
Fashima: Understood?!
Frogman: Y-yes...
