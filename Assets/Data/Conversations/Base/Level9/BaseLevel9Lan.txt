Frogman: Can you tell me a bit about Lan? He seems... eccentric.
Fashima: Oh, him.\a Pay no mind to him - he is irrelevant.
Frogman: Irrelevant?
Fashima: Yes. The other Magi kept pestering me about picking an\a apprentice.
So I picked the most obnoxious one I could fine.
I hope he's not giving you too much trouble.
Frogman: He is a bit annoying, I have to admit.
Fashima: Did you manage to kill him?
:if:compareCounter:LanLoseCount:>2{
Frogman: No... He keeps running away before we can finish him.
}
:else:{
Frogman: Not yet... He managed to get away.
}
Fashima: I see. I apologize for any inconvenience he may have\a caused.
It was not my intention to harm you, my friend.
Frogman: Right...
