# Fashima actually tells the truth here, except for being a Magmaborn
Frogman: Why did you join us? Why did you betray the other Magi?
Fashima: Do you know how long I've been alive, my friend?
Frogman: Uh... No.
Fashima: Me neither. But a few millenia, at least.
Frogman: Millenia?! But... But you look so young! How can that be?!
Fashima: Magic, my friend. Magic can transform you.\a Keep your body young and healthy.\a Indefinitely.
Frogman: This is... Uh... Wow.
But this has nothing to do with my question.\a Why did you let yourself die now?
Fashima: This has everything to do with your question.
I've been alive for far longer than any other Magi.
Longer than any other human, I'd wager.\a And do you know how I spent this time?
Frogman: No.
Fashima: Protecting humanity from monsters,\a and your fellow Magmaborn.\a Over and over again. Endlessly.\a I couldn't bear it any more.
Frogman: Why didn't you just leave?
Fashima: You misunderstand my goal.
It wasn't merely to stop being a Magus -\a but rather to end this eternal,\a foolish struggle once and for all.
Frogman: So you became a Magmaborn?
Fashima: Yes. The only one capable of ending the Magi is a Magus.
Frogman: I see...
