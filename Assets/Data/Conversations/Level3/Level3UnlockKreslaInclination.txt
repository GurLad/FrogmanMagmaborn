Kresla: Hey, Frogman!
Frogman: Yes?
Kresla: Do you think I could fight like the Lich?
Frogman: With magic? How?
Kresla: No, no, nothing like that.
I meant focusing on my skill, like you.\a I couldn't help but notice you've changed your\a own focus lately.
Frogman: Ah. All right, I guess.
Kresla: What happened to your enthusiasm?
Never mind, let's just defeat this Lich.
