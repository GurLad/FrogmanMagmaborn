# === Functions ====

~ PreFirbell
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Firbell: Oh no. Frogman, we need to turn back.\a Now.
Frogman: Huh? Why?
Firbell: Do you see that monster there?\a It is a Lich.
One of the strongest monsters around here,\a capable of devastating Black Magic.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Firbell: Because monsters cannot naturally use it.\a They do not feel pain, the fuel for magic.
The Lich will not attack us unless provoked,\a so we should leave-
Frogman: Why leave? Let's defeat it.
It's a better goal than endlessly wandering around,\a don't you think?
Firbell: Are you crazy?! It is much too powerful!
Frogman: It's not like dying costs us anything...
Firbell: No, but-
Frogman: Then let's go!
Firbell: What are you doing?!\a ...
I can't just let you go on your own!
Oh well, time to slay a few fiends.

~ PreKresla
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Kresla: Frogman? I hate to say this, but we must run.\a Now!
Frogman: Huh? Why?
Kresla: Do you see that monster there? It's a Lich! A mighty undead wizard!
Frogman: Wizard? Never seen any before here.
Kresla: Oh, let me explain!
Regular magic requires pain -\a which is why humans don't use it,\a at least where I come from.\a Irenhold's people apperantly felt otherwise.\a Or at least the royalty. I wonder how they got people-
Frogman: Kresla. About the Lich.
Kresla: Right, right. Monsters can't feel pain,\a as you've probably noticed.\a Which makes most of them unable to use magic,\a like Xirveros.
I don't know how the Liches do it!\a Every time I get close to study one, it kill me.
Frogman: Well, that was before my time, right?
Kresla: Obviously. Are you thinking what I am?
Frogman: Yes, let's defeat it. It's a better goal
than endlessly wandering around.
Kresla: Oh! I like your style!
I WILL find out your secret, lich!
Frogman: Let's go!

~ PreXirveros
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: Well, those monsters weren't that-
:play:ToTheDeath
Xirveros: Frog? Bad monster here. Very bad.
Frogman: What monster?
Xirveros: Bad monster!\a Scary monster!\a Magic monster!
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Xirveros: Magic rare! Magic bad! Magic painful!
Frogman: Uh... Sure...\a Let's go defeat it then.
Xirveros: Frog crazy!
...
Follow frog!

~ PreAlone
:play:BeforeBattle
Frogman: I'm all alone again...
# TBA: add Kresla or Firbell (de[ending on who died)
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: Fine. I'll do this myself.

~ PreAfterFail
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: You again. This time, I won't lose.

~ PostFirbell
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
:play:AfterBattle
Firbell: Frogman, wait. We should not go that far.
Frogman: Huh? Why not?
Firbell: The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters become.\a Like that Lich we just fought.\a We should stick close to where we were Born.
Frogman: Sure, there might be tough enemies ahead.
But we're immortal, so we might as well fight them.
Firbell: We could just survive as long as we can.\a This is what I have done thus far.
Frogman: I'm sorry, but that sounds pointless.
Firbell: Do you want to end up like Xirveros?\a Because that was what he did.
Frogman: Huh. Good to know.\a But I'm not Xirveros.\a I must go ahead anyway.\a Are you coming?
Firbell: What?! Did you not listen to a word-
And there he goes again. The fool...

~ PostKresla
Kresla: Oh.\a It just disintegrated.\a What a shame.
Frogman: Kresla, we need to get out of here now!
Kresla: No, wait!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
:play:AfterBattle
Kresla: Frogman! Wait up! Before you go on,
you should know that there will be tougher enemies ahead.
Frogman: How do you know that?
Kresla: Through trial and error, of course!\a The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters become,\a like the Lich.
That's why people like me tend to stay near where we're Born.
Frogman: I didn't expect that from you, the fearless scholar.
Kresla: Unforunatly, bravery alone isn't enough to beat stronger\a monsters, like the Lich.\a But with our powers combined,\a we can be unstopable!
Frogman: Yes. So let's go.

~ PostXirveros
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
:play:AfterBattle
Xirveros: Frog! Turn back. Now. This too far!
Frogman: Why would I do that?
Xirveros: They will come. You will fight.\a We will die.
Frogman: Xirveros, you're not making any sense.
Xirveros: Frog, don't make my mistake.
Turn back before it's too late.
Frogman: But why? What will happen?
Xirveros: Do not listen. Do not listen. Do no listen.
Frogman: Why do I even bother? Let's just go.

~ PostGeneric
Frogman: That was tough! I'm sorry, everyone.
I'll just have to go on without you.
