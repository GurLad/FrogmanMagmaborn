Firbell: Frogman.
Frogman: Yes?
Firbell: About Xirveros' associates.
I have never heard of them when I was alive,\a and Xirveros never talked about them much.
Frogman: Oh.
Firbell: But Abrhys is a peculiar case.
What was a commoner from Abenzon doing in Irenhold?
Frogman: How can you tell he's a commoner from Abenzon?
Firbell: His name, obviously.
Frogman: Huh?
Firbell: Where are you from, that you do not know this?\a Ab stands for Abenzon.\a And he has no title.\a Thus, a commoner from Abenzon.
Frogman: I... see.
Firbell: Foreigners are usually merchants or workers,\a not wizards.\a What was his relation to Xirveros?
Frogman: Too bad we can't really ask him.
Firbell: Yes. He...\a ...
Frogman: Again? Urgh...
