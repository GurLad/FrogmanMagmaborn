Frogman: Firbell. Have you heard about Xirveros' friends?
Firbell: What? I do not remember him mentioning friends.
Frogman: What were their names?\a Abrhys?\a Welki?

Firbell: Frogman.
Frogman: Yes?
Firbell: About Xirveros' associates.
I have never heard of them when I was alive,\a and Xirveros never talked about them much.
Frogman: Oh.
Firbell: But they have very peculiar names.\a What was a commoner from Abenzon doing in\a Irenhold? And where did this Welki even come from?
I have never heard such a name besides here.
Frogman: What's so weird about it?
Firbell: I do not recognize her title, if it even is one,\a nor her place of birth.
She must have come from a very far away place, like Kresla.\a And you.
Frogman: I... see. Hm...
