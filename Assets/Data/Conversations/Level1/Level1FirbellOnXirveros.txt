Frogman: Oh. Hello, Firbell.
Firbell: Hello.
Frogman: I wanted to talk to you about Xirveros.\a He's clearly quite insane.\a How can we truly trust him?
Firbell: ...What did you just imply?
Frogman: Just that maybe trusting an utter madman with our lives\a isn't the brightest idea.
And we could just ignore him, or even kill-
Firbell: Frogman. Stop that at once, before I kill you myself.
Frogman: What? Why? Listen, I know-
Firbell: You do not know.\a He was both my mentor and only companion\a for an incredibly long time.\a He was given the utmost honour a commoner ever could by my\a own royal family.\a Show him disrespect,\a and you insult both me and my entire lineage.\a Do not go down that path.
Frogman: Is that a threat?
Firbell: It very much is.
Frogman: I... see.
Firbell: ...
Frogman: Uh.\a Let's just kill these monsters or something, yeah?
Firbell: Very well.\a And do not bring that up ever again.
