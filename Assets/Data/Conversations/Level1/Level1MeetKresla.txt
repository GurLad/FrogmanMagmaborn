Kresla|???: I've never seen you before!\a More than that, I've never seen your KIND before!\a You must be new here!
Frogman: Who are you? Where's Firbell?
Kresla|???: Right, of course, where are my manners?
Kresla||L: My name is Kresla, a renowned scholar.
You've probably heard of me when you were still alive.\a Assuming we were alive around the same time and place.\a Where are you from?
Frogman: Um, I don't remember.
Kresla: Oh well. Let me know once you do!\a Oh, you asked me something, didn't you?
Frogman: Yes, where is Firbell?
Never mind, we are surrounded by monsters,\a let's deal with them first.
Kresla: Yes, yes, the boring monsters first.

Kresla: Now that's taken care of, where were we?\a Right, Firbell. You're very new, aren't you?
Frogman: Yes, I am.
Kresla: And a new monster type, to boot!\a This is quite the discovery!\a If only I could tell my fellow scholars...
But those cowards would never come here.\a Anyway, did you say something?
Frogman: No, but-
Kresla: Ah, right! You wanted to know where Firbell is!
Well, each time we are Born is from a different place,\a and always from Magma.
This time, you returned near me. Last time, near Firbell.\a If only I could map this place... It's huge!
Frogman: Ah, that makes sense. Shall we leave now?
Kresla: Did I tell you about Firbell's kingdom? That was my first discovery here! You see, where she comes from...
Frogman: Right. I'm leaving.
Kresla: ...she still thinks... Huh? Wait for me!
