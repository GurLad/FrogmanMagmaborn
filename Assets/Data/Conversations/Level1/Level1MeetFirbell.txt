Firbell|???: I have not seen you before.
Are you new here?
Frogman: Y-Yes? What is this place?\a What is going on?
Firbell|???: Ah. First of all, do not panic.\a You are dead.
Frogman: What?!
Firbell|???: Do you remember your previous life?
Frogman: No...
Firbell|???: Quite common. I will explain all in time.\a However, as you have probably noticed,\a we are surrounded by monsters.
Frogman: Monsters?!
Firbell|???: Yes. I do not have time to explain. Ready your bow.
Frogman: My b-bow?\a Right, I have a bow...
Firbell||L: My name is Firbell, by the way.

Frogman: We've won... What were those things?
Firbell: Dead people. Like us.
Frogman: What do you mean? They were mindless beasts!
Firbell: Yes. We retain our mind using Emblems.\a You have one on you as well.
:showImage:Emblem
Frogman: Huh? You mean this crystal thing?
Firbell: Yes, of course.
I have one too, as do all sapient beings here.
You have probably noticed it on my crown.
Frogman: Where is it from?
Firbell: Our previous lives.
Frogman: Do you remember your previous life?
Firbell: Of course I do. You will as well, soon enough.
I am princess Firbell of Irenhold,\a daughter of queen Kirmella and heir to the\a throne.
Frogman: Uh...\a Isn't it more likely someone else inherited the\a throne when you died?
Firbell: ...I am sorry, did you say something, frog?
By the way, you haven't told me your name yet.
Frogman: I... don't remember it.\a But I do remember being called...
Frogman.
Firbell: What? That is impossible.
We all remember our name when we are first Born.
Frogman: Born?
Firbell: Revive from the Magma.\a You are a strange case, Frogman.
Let us leave this place before more monsters show up.
