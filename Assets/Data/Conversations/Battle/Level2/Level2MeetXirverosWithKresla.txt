Xirveros: I like rocks. This lucky rock. Mine!
Frogman: Okay...\a Frankly, he doesn't seem like a mighty wizard.\a No offense, Xirveros.
Xirveros: Only defense!
Kresla: According to Firbell, he went mad one day.\a It was long before I was born,\a and I can no longer ask here.\a So many mysteries...
Xirveros: Ohh! I have song! I shall sing!

Xirveros: I was a great wizard   \w@
