Frogman: Oh. Hello again, Xirveros.
Xirveros: Frog, frog, frog. Frog.
Frogman: If you say so.
Xirveros: And Irbell! Or are Mirbell? Xirbell?
Firbell: Firbell, Xirveros. Firbell.
Xirveros: No, no Firbell. Firlor only!
Frogman: What is he talking about?
Firbell: He appears to be delirious today.\a He is talking about Irenhold's old royal family,\a from the time he was still alive.
Firlor was the heir of Irenhold during all his life.
Xirveros: Must talk to Kirsong! Where is he? Where?!
Firbell: It is best to ignore him in this state.\a We should get out of here quickly.
Frogman: All right, Firbell. Let's go.
