Xirveros: I like frogs. Frogs like me back.
Frogman: Ok... Sure...

Firbell: Where were we? Ah, right, Xirveros.\a He made the first Magma Emblem,\a and gave Irenhold's royal family mine\a - the one on my crown.
Xirveros: I like rocks. This lucky rock. Mine!
Firbell: The rock on his head is his own Magma Emblem.
Frogman: Okay...\a Frankly, he doesn't seem like a mighty wizard.\a No offense, Xirveros.
Xirveros: Only defense!
Firbell: Well, as you can see, he went mad one day.\a I do not know what happened.\a But he was my mentor when I first arrived,\a and I would not have survived without him.
Xirveros: Ohh! I have song! I shall sing!
Frogman: Is this really nes-
Xirveros: I was a great wizard   \w@
I never ate a lizard   \w@
I like rocks           \w@
Yet hate locks         \w@
I never liked blue     \w@
Smiles will betray you \w@

Let us leave this place before more monsters show up.
Frogman: ...and before he starts singing again.

Frogman: Okay...\a Frankly, he doesn't seem like a mighty wizard.\a No offense, Xirveros.
Xirveros: Only defense!
Kresla: According to Firbell, he went mad one day.\a It was long before I was born,\a and I can no longer ask here.\a So many mysteries...

Firbell: Yes. It is a shame, but he will be back before long.
Frogman: Can you tell me more about him?
Firbell: Yes.\a He made the first Magma Emblem,\a and gave Irenhold's royal family mine -\a the one on my crown.\a And the rock on his head is his own Magma Emblem.
Frogman: Wow. How did he do that?
Firbell: As I have said, he had been a mighty wizard before he died.
Frogman: What happened to him afterwards?
Firbell: Well, as you could see, he went mad one day.\a I do not know what happened.
But he was my mentor when I first arrived,\a and I would not have survived without him.\a But that is enough about him.
Let us leave this place before more monsters show up.
