# AKA met, but Firbell died so she couldn't tell his backstory
Firbell: Hello, Xirveros.
Xirveros: Hello!
Frogman: Him again?
Firbell: I did not get to tell you more about him last time, did I?
Frogman: No, only that he was a wizard of Irenhold.
Firbell: He was much more than that.\a He made the first Magma Emblem,\a and gave Irenhold's royal family mine -\a the one on my crown.

Frogman: ...Xirveros.
Xirveros: Hello!
Firbell||R: You know Xirveros, Frogman?
Frogman: Yes, I've seen him once or twice before.\a He's utterly mad.
Firbell: Perhaps he is now, but he used to be much more than that.\a He made the first Magma Emblem,\a and gave Irenhold's royal family mine -\a the one on my crown.

Xirveros: I like rocks. This lucky rock. Mine!
Firbell: The rock on his head is his own Magma Emblem.
Frogman: Okay...\a Frankly, he doesn't seem like a mighty wizard.\a No offense, Xirveros.
Xirveros: Only defense!
Firbell: Well, as you can see, he went mad one day.\a I do not know what happened.\a But he was my mentor when I first arrived,\a and I would not have survived without him.
Frogman: I... see.
:loadUnits::monster:T
Xirveros: Oh no! Monsters are here!
Firbell: It seems our time is up, Frogman.\a Let us behead a few fiends, shall we?
