Kresla||L: Hi there! I've never seen you before!\a Where are you from?
Alfred: ...Alezis.
Kresla: Um, I've never heard of it.
Alfred: Pah. You heard about Guard name?\a Bronzing?
Kresla: Wait, Bronzing? I'm from there!
Alfred: Ha! Fool!\a That's Guard name.\a They try erasing our history.\a Our names!\a We mustn't forget!\a Do not listen!
Kresla: Uh, look, when I come from, there are no "Guards".\a Bronzing is an independant country.\a But now that you mention it, Alezis never appeared in any history I know of.\a Interesting! So these Guards did erase your history!
Alfred: What?! You...\a Pah. They're coming.\a Get ready.
Kresla: How can you-
