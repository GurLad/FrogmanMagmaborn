Xeplogi: Ah. Thank you for helping me escape these lunatics.
Frogman: You mentioned knowing these... Guards before.\a Who are they? What are they doing here?
Xeplogi: They are annoying pests.
They are as numerous as the monsters,\a and about as intelligent.
In fact, I doubt that there's much human about them.
Frogman: Really? They seemed human enough.
Xeplogi: Did you notice how they just disintegrated when killed?\a Like the monsters?
:if:hasCharacter:Kresla{
Kresla: Oh! I was wondering about that!\a Do you have any idea how they do that?
}
:else:{
Frogman: Huh. Do you know why?
}
Xeplogi: I do not, unfortunatly. It must be some sort of magic.\a And the only one I know who might have the answer is...\a Memerian, unfortunatly.
:if:hasCharacter:Xirveros{
Xirveros: Oh! I know! They just eat three apples a day!
Xeplogi: ...I highly doubt that.
}
Frogman: Who is this Memerian?
Xeplogi: She is an evil and backstabbing witch.
She used to be a blacksmith,\a but then started meddling with dark magics.\a This is how she found both our Magma Emblems.
Frogman: So... she's another Magmaborn?
Xeplogi: Yes. We are doomed to suffer her presence for all eternity.\a Luckily, I'm here to protect you from her trickery.
Frogman: I see. And she knows what's the deal with these Guards?
Xeplogi: Whether she does or not, all she ever speaks is lies,\a so asking her about it is futile.\a But let us stop speaking of the devil.\a We should move on before the Guards catch up to us.
Frogman: Actually, we're on our way to that weird fortress.
Xeplogi: You what?! But that is suicide!
Frogman: You've actually been there?!
Xeplogi: N-no, but it sounds dangerous!
Frogman: ...So you're a coward, then?
Xeplogi: How dare you insult my honour like that!
Frogman: Then let's go!

Did they build the fortress and all other structures?\a Why are they fighting us?\a And most of all,\a why do they disintigrate upon death?
Frogman: I don't kn- wait, disintigrate?
Kresla: Didn't you notice? Whenever one dies,\a they just disappear, like the monsters.\a Could they be the same thing?
But no, these Guards appear to have intelligence...\a This place holds so many mysteries!
Frogman: Yeah. That's definitley weird.
Kresla: I do have a few theo-

Firbell: Yes.\a Did you notice how the humans disintigrated?
Frogman: Holy subject change, Firbell.\a Anyway- wait, what?\a Disintigrated?
Firbell: Yes. Whenever one died, they just disappeared.\a Like the monsters.
Frogman: I didn't notice. What do you think this means?
Firbell: I do not know.
Frogman: ...\a I see. Well, let's not worry about it for now.\a We're getting pretty close to the fortress.\a Let's just move on.

Everyone could hear \w@
As green as the sea \w@
He was nice to me   \w@
Said he was of Jess \w@
And I just said yes \w@
Frogman: ...Wow.
Xirveros: And what about humans? They just vanished!\a Like we!
Frogman: Because we ran away?
Xirveros: No, when fighting! They vanish like monsters!

I assume you'll run into her eventually.
