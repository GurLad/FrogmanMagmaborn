Alfred: What.
Frogman||R: What?
Kresla: I want to know everything about Bomzing during your time!\a And you will tell me!
Alfred: Pah! Stop using Guard name!\a And I will never talk!
Kresla: Oh, really? Frogman! Get me my devices!
Frogman: What devices?
Kresla: The torture devices, obviously!
Frogman: I... Listen, we don't have time for this nonsense.\a There are Guards and monsters here, and-
Kresla: Oh, who cares about them! We've talked about this, Frogman.\a You agreed to help me torture Alfred!
Frogman: I-I did?
Alfred: You did?!\a Pah!\a Ungrateful fools, all of you!
Kresla: Hey, you're the one who won't talk!

Kresla: Don't tell me you bought that little show he pulled on.\a He obviously faked his death to avoid torture.
Frogman: You think he faked his death?
Kresla: Obivously! That's the only logical conclusion!\a We need to go search for him now,\a while the trail is still hot!\a He couldn't have gone far yet!
Frogman: You... What.
Kresla: Oh, we don't have time for this! Come on, follow me!

Frogman: Uh...
Alfred: But you help fight the Guards.\a And I need help.\a ...We can remain allies.\a For now.
Frogman: Thanks...?
