Xeplogi: Hold! Who goes there?!
Frogman: It's Frogman-
Xeplogi: You! How can you speak?
What manner of black magic is this?!\a Were you sent here by Memerian?!
Frogman: What? No, it's us-
Xeplogi: Your trickery cannot fool me, foul demon!\a I, the humble servant of the glorious Tori,\a am the only person worthy enough to be reborn,\a sent to defeat the evil Memerian and\a her nasty minions!
Frogman: ...Xeplogi. It's me. We're back.\a Did you forget us so quickly?
Xeplogi: The time for chatter is up! Prepare to be-

Guard1: ...Pfft! Ha ha ha!
Guard2: Silence!\a Ugh, look! You've ruined our ambush!
Xeplogi: W-who dares interr-
Frogman: Oh no. We don't have time for this. Uh...\a Xeplogi! On behalf of the divine Tori,\a I order you to join us!
Xeplogi: You cannot speak for him, fool! Only I can!
Frogman: Oops. Um... Please join us anyway?
Guard1: Oh my! Please go on! This is the best show ever!
Xeplogi: Do not mock me, human! Or you shall feel the wrath of Tori!
Frogman: Yeah! These humans were probably sent here by\a Memerian! We must defeat them!
Xeplogi: You might be on to them, Frog!\a Fine then, let us join forces!
Frogman: ...That was surprisingly easy.

Frogman: I- you know what, never mind.\a Yes, we're Tori followers.\a Happy now?

Firbell: Frogman.
Frogman: Yes?
Firbell: Are you sure that siding with this lunatic is a good idea?
Frogman: He's a Magmaborn, like us.\a We should all help each other,\a regardless of our conditions.
Firbell: ...Very well. I will trust you on this.\a But these humans... Why are we fighting them?
Frogman: They attacked us.\a Do we need another reason?
Firbell: Yet they are sentinet beings, like us.\a Should we not join forces, as you yourself said?
Frogman: Xeplogi didn't attack us.
Firbell: We do appear as monsters.
What if they were sent here by Irenhold?\a We must inform them I am here.
Frogman: So this is what it's all about, eh?
Firbell: It would be dishonorable to fight without a formal-
Frogman: No, I get it. We'll try talking to them then.\a But I doubt they'll listen.
Firbell: Very well. Thank you, Frogman.
