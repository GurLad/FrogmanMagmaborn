Xeplogi: I'm afraid I never caught your name, er...?
Kresla: Right, sorry. I'm Kresla, a renowned scholar.\a And you're Vengeful Xeplogi, right?
Xeplogi: Only my enemies call me that. Please, call me Duke Xeplogi.
Kresla: I knew it! It IS you! So this is where you disappeared to?!\a Wait, does that mean that Memerian is here too?!
Xeplogi: Unfortunately, yes.
I assume you'll run into her eventually.
Kresla: I can't believe it! A fairy tale hero,\a standing right here besides me!\a This is almost as exciting as the discovery of magic!
Xeplogi: I'm a hero, then? Oh ho ho! I like the sound of that.
Frogman: I'm afraid I didn't get any of this.
Kresla: What, you don't know Xeplogi and the Witch?\a It's a popular children's story!
Xeplogi: W-wait, children?!
Kresla: In short, there was this duke named Xeplogi,\a who wanted to be immortal.
He heard about a legendary blacksmith named Memerian,
who was said to have discovered immortality.\a Xeplogi tried to buy her secret, but she refused,\a so they fought over it,\a and then both disappeared.
Frogman: That's... a pretty lame story.
Xeplogi: It's a very rough outline. What really happened was-
