Uh, I'm Frogman, and these are my fellow Magmaborn.
Firbell||L: I am Firbell, the princess of Irenhold. Who are you?
Xeplogi|???: Princess, are you? And of a made-up kingdom, no less.\a How amusing. Oh ho ho!
Firbell: Excuse me? Made up kingdom?!\a Are you from the same backwater village as Kresla?!
Xeplogi|???: Backwater village? I'm no peasant, girl.
Xeplogi||R: I am the Duke of Jess, Xeplogi the Third.\a Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Firbell: Claiming to be a duke when you are not a noble?
And of a made up place you are not even from?\a Pathetic.\a Froman, let us leave this poor fool alone.
Xeplogi: H-how dare you insult me like that!\a Jess is the most important duchy of Enkress,\a you-

Frogman: Likew- Wait, what?
Xeplogi: You died last time we fought together.\a That was a very bad idea.
Frogman: It... wasn't my idea.
Xeplogi: Really? Then we should punish whoever suggested it.\a It was absolutley terrible.
