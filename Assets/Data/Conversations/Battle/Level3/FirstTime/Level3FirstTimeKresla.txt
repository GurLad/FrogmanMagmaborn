Frogman: Wow.\a Kresla, what is that thing?
Kresla: Ah, sharp eye! This is the greatest mystery in here!\a Firbell called it the Fortress,\a but refused to elaborate.\a I'd love to explore it one day!
Frogman: Why haven't you?
Kresla: It's not so simple.
That place is guarded by many strong monsters -\a mostly liches.\a I could never defeat them alone.
Frogman: Liches?
Kresla: Mighty undead wizards! Ones actually capable of magic,\a unlike Xirveros.
I've never seen wizards when I was alive,\a but this place is filled with them!\a Only dead ones, but still.\a I don't know why they disappeared -\a but I will find out one day!\a I do have a few-
Frogman: Kresla. About the liches.
Kresla: Right, right. Firbell told me -\a before she stopped talking to me, that is -\a that magic is done through unique crystals.
Since liches have these crystals,\a they can wield magic!\a But every time I get close to study one,\a it kills me.
Here, let me show you. Follow me!
Frogman: Wait, where are you going?
Kresla: To the Fortress!

Frogman: Is that monster there a lich?
Kresla: Indeed! Fancy fighting it?
Frogman: Yes, let's defeat it.
It's a better goal than endlessly wandering around.
Kresla: Oh! I like your style!\a I WILL find out your secret, lich!
Frogman: Let's go!

Frogman: Kresla, we need to get out of here now!

Wow! I cannot believe we did it!\a We actually beat a lich!
Frogman: Yes. Although the Fortress is still pretty far away...
Kresla: Still, this is uncharted territory!\a I can't wait to find out what's out there!\a The source of magic?\a Aliens?\a More types of monsters? Maybe even some humans!\a I mean, someone had to build that fortress! Or could it be a tribe of magmaborn? Perhaps an underground civilization! Could dwarves actually be real? No, those are fairy tales... Then again, so is magic. You can never be sure anymore, eh, Frogman?
Frogman: Uh, y-yes, of course.
Kresla: There's so much to discover! Frogman, are you coming?
With our powers combined, we can be unstoppable!
