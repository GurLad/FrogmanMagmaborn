Frogman: Wow.\a Firbell, what is that thing?
Firbell: What are you- Oh.\a You mean the fortress.
Frogman: Fortress?
Firbell: Xirveros told me about it, back before he went mad.\a He told me to stay away from it.
Frogman: Do you know why?
Firbell: Yes. It is guarded by many strong monsters.
Frogman: I see. Let's try going there.
Firbell: Why would we? It is quite dangerous.
Frogman: It's a better goal than endlessly wandering around,\a don't you think?
Firbell: I would rather stay alive.
Frogman: It's not like dying costs us anything...
Firbell: No, but-
Frogman: Then let's go!
Firbell: ...This is a bad idea...

:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: Uh, Firbell? What is that monster over there?
Is it one of those so-called strong monsters?
Firbell: Indeed. This one is a lich.
One of the strongest monsters around here,\a capable of devastating magic.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Firbell: Because magic requires magic crystals,\a which are exceedingly rare,\a especially here.
Frogman: Aren't our Magma Emblems crystals?
Firbell: Yes, but not magic crystals.\a They cannot be used for normal magic.
Frogman: Oh.
Firbell: Are you certain you wish to fight it?
Frogman: Yes. Are you with me?
Firbell: Ah, you leave me no choice...\a I can't just let you go on your own.\a Oh well, time to slay a few fiends.

Firbell: Frogman? Where are you going?
Frogman: To the Fortress, of course?
Firbell: To the Fortress? Why would you do that?
Are you not aware of the monsters guarding the way?
Frogman: Yes, I'm aware of the liches.\a I fought one before, in fact.
Firbell: Oh? And did you manage to defeat it?
Frogman: ...No.
Firbell: As I thought. Let us leave this place before-
Frogman: Leave? Why? We can defeat it together.
Firbell: I would rather stay alive.
Frogman: Are you truly so afraid of liches?
Firbell: I am not afraid. I am merely being reasonably cautious.\a But very well, have it your way.\a Let us defeat this so-called lich.
Frogman: Great.

Firbell: Frogman, wait.
Frogman: What is it, Firbell?
Firbell: Are you sure you want to go on?
Frogman: Yes. Aren't you curious what's in the Fortress?\a Or why is it so heavily guarded?
Firbell: I admit that I am.\a However, I do not want to end up like Xirveros.
Frogman: What's he got to do with it?
Firbell: He used to go to the Fortress all the time.\a Before he went mad.
Frogman: Huh. Good to know.
But I cannot accept a life of endless, pointless survival.\a Don't you want to find a way to leave this place?
Firbell: I do. Getting back to Irenhold...\a Yes, I must do my best to return.\a Very well, Frogman. Let us go.
