Frogman: Wow.\a Firbell, what is that thing?
Firbell: What are you- Oh.\a You mean the fortress.
Frogman: Fortress?
Firbell: Xirveros told me about it, back before he went mad.\a He told me to stay away from it.
Frogman: Do you know why?
Firbell: Yes. It is guarded by many strong monsters.
Frogman: I see. Let's try going there.
Firbell: Why would we? It is quite dangerous.
Frogman: It's a better goal than endlessly wandering around,\a don't you think?
Firbell: I would rather stay alive.
Frogman: It's not like dying costs us anything...
Firbell: No, but-
Frogman: Then let's go!
Firbell: ...This is a bad idea...
:hideCG:
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: Uh, Firbell? What is that monster over there?
Is it one of those so-called strong monsters?
Firbell: Indeed. This one is a lich.
One of the strongest monsters around here,\a capable of devastating magic.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Firbell: Because magic requires magic crystals,\a which are exceedingly rare,\a especially here.
Frogman: Aren't our Magma Emblems crystals?
Firbell: Yes, but not magic crystals.\a They cannot be used for normal magic.
Frogman: Oh.
Firbell: Are you certain you wish to fight it?
Frogman: Yes. Are you with me?
Firbell: Ah, you leave me no choice...\a I can't just let you go on your own.\a Oh well, time to slay a few fiends.

~ PreKresla
:play:BeforeBattle
:showCG:FortressPreview
Frogman: Wow.\a Kresla, what is that thing?
Kresla: Ah, sharp eye! This is the greatest mystery in here!\a Firbell called it the Fortress,\a but refused to elaborate.\a I'd love to explore it one day!
Frogman: Why haven't you?
Kresla: It's not so simple.
That place is guarded by many strong monsters -\a mostly liches.\a I could never defeat them alone.
Frogman: Liches?
Kresla: Mighty undead wizards! Ones actually capable of magic,\a unlike Xirveros.
I've never seen wizards when I was alive,\a but this place is filled with them!\a Only dead ones, but still.\a I don't know why they disappeared -\a but I will find out one day!\a I do have a few-
Frogman: Kresla. About the liches.
Kresla: Right, right. Firbell told me -\a before she stopped talking to me, that is -\a that magic is done through unique crystals.
Since liches have these crystals,\a they can wield magic!\a But every time I get close to study one,\a it kills me.
Here, let me show you. Follow me!
Frogman: Wait, where are you going?
Kresla: To the Fortress!
:hideCG:
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: Is that monster there a lich?
Kresla: Indeed! Fancy fighting it?
Frogman: Yes, let's defeat it.
It's a better goal than endlessly wandering around.
Kresla: Oh! I like your style!\a I WILL find out your secret, lich!
Frogman: Let's go!

~ PreXirveros
:play:BeforeBattle
:showCG:FortressPreview
Frogman: Wow.\a Xirveros, what is that thing?
Xirveros: That Fortress. Bad Fortress!
Frogman: Why bad?
Xirveros: People there. Monsters there. They there!
Frogman: Wait, people?
Xirveros: Blue people! Green people! Red people!
Frogman: Sure...\a Let's go there then.
Xirveros: Go? Go go? Go go go?
Frogman: ...I'm going, Xirveros. Are you coming?
Xirveros: Me go after frog!
:hideCG:
:play:ToTheDeath
Frog? Bad monster here. Very bad.
Frogman: What monster?
Xirveros: Bad monster!\a Scary monster!\a Magic monster!
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Xirveros: Magic rare! Magic bad! Magic painful!
Frogman: Uh... Sure...\a Let's go defeat it then.
Xirveros: Frog crazy!
...
Follow frog!

~ PreAlone
:play:BeforeBattle
:showCG:FortressPreview
Frogman: I'm all alone again... Wait, what is that thing?
Wow. It looks like a huge underground fortress!
I guess I'll go there.
# TBA: add Kresla or Firbell (de[ending on who died)

:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: What is this-\a Ugh, I'm talking to myself.\a I need to stop that.

~ PreAfterFail
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: You again. This time, I won't lose.

~ PostFirbell
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!

:play:SafeAndSound
Firbell: Frogman, wait.
Frogman: What is it, Firbell?
Firbell: Are you sure you want to go on?
Frogman: Yes. Aren't you curious what's in the Fortress?\a Or why is it so heavily guarded?
Firbell: I admit that I am.\a However, I do not want to end up like Xirveros.
Frogman: What's he got to do with it?
Firbell: He used to go to the Fortress all the time.\a Before he went mad.
Frogman: Huh. Good to know.
But I cannot accept a life of endless, pointless survival.\a Don't you want to find a way to leave this place?
Firbell: I do. Getting back to Irenhold...\a Yes, I must do my best to return.\a Very well, Frogman. Let us go.
Frogman: That's the spirit.

~ PostKresla
Kresla: Oh.\a It just disintegrated.\a What a shame.
Frogman: Kresla, we need to get out of here now!
Kresla: Right!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
:play:SafeAndSound
Wow! I cannot believe we did it!\a We actually beat a lich!
Frogman: Yes. Although the Fortress is still pretty far away...
Kresla: Still, this is uncharted territory!\a I can't wait to find out what's out there!\a The source of magic?\a Aliens?\a More types of monsters? Maybe even some humans!\a I mean, someone had to build that fortress! Or could it be a tribe of magmaborn? Perhaps an underground civilization! Could dwarves actually be real? No, those are fairy tales... Then again, so is magic. You can never be sure anymore, eh, Frogman?
Frogman: Uh, y-yes, of course.
Kresla: There's so much to discover! Frogman, are you coming?
With our powers combined, we can be unstoppable!

~ PostXirveros
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!

Xirveros: Frog! Turn back. Now. This too far!
Frogman: Why would I do that?
Xirveros: They will come. You will fight.\a We will die.
Frogman: Xirveros, you're not making any sense.
Xirveros: Frog, don't make my mistake.
Turn back before it's too late.
Frogman: But why? What will happen?
Xirveros: Do not listen. Do not listen. Do no listen.
Frogman: Why do I even bother? Let's just go.

~ PostGeneric
Frogman: That was tough! I'm sorry, everyone.
I'll just have to go on without you.
