Frogman: Wow.\a Firbell, what is that thing?
Firbell: What are you- Oh.\a You mean the Fortress.
Frogman: Fortress?
Firbell: Xirveros told me about it, back before he went mad.\a He told me to stay away from it.
Frogman: Do you know why?
Firbell: Yes. It is guarded by many strong monsters.
Frogman: I see. Let's try going there.
Firbell: Why would we? It is quite dangerous.
Frogman: It's a better goal than endlessly wandering around,\a don't you think?
Firbell: I would rather stay alive.
Frogman: It's not like dying costs us anything...
Firbell: No, but-
Frogman: Then let's go!
Firbell: ...This is a bad idea...
:hideCG:
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: Uh, Firbell? What is that monster over there?
Is it one of those so-called strong monsters?
Firbell: Indeed. This one is a lich.
One of the strongest monsters around here,\a capable of devastating magic.
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Firbell: Because magic requires magic crystals,\a which are exceedingly rare,\a especially here.
Frogman: Aren't our Magma Emblems crystals?
Firbell: Yes, but not magic crystals.\a They cannot be used for normal magic.
Frogman: Oh.
Firbell: Are you certain you wish to fight it?
Frogman: Yes. Are you with me?
Firbell: Ah, you leave me no choice...\a I can't just let you go on your own.\a Oh well, time to slay a few fiends.

~ PreKresla
:play:BeforeBattle
:showCG:FortressPreview
Frogman: Wow.\a Kresla, what is that thing?
Kresla: Ah, sharp eye! This is the greatest mystery in here!\a Firbell called it the Fortress,\a but refused to elaborate.\a I'd love to explore it one day!
Frogman: Why haven't you?
Kresla: It's not so simple.
That place is guarded by many strong monsters -\a mostly liches.\a I could never defeat them alone.
Frogman: Liches?
Kresla: Mighty undead wizards! Ones actually capable of magic,\a unlike Xirveros.
Kresla: I've actually only seen wizards here!\a Although, only dead liches, but still.\a I don't know why they disappeared -\a but I will find out one day! I do have a few-
Frogman: Kresla. About the Lich.
Kresla: Right, right. Firbell told me -\a before she stopped talking to me, that is -\a that magic is done through unique crystals.
Since the lich has one, it can wield magic!\a But every time I get close to study one,\a it kills me.
Here, I'll show. Follow me!
Frogman: Wait, where are you going?
Kresla: To the Fortress!
:hideCG:
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: Is that the lich?
Kresla: Indeed! Fancy fighting it?
Frogman: Yes, let's defeat it.
It's a better goal than endlessly wandering around.
Kresla: Oh! I like your style!\a I WILL find out your secret, lich!
Frogman: Let's go!

~ PreXirveros
:play:BeforeBattle
:showCG:FortressPreview
Frogman: Wow.\a Xirveros, what is that thing?
Xirveros: That Fortress. Bad Fortress!
Frogman: Why bad?
Xirveros: People there. Monsters there. They there!
Frogman: Wait, people?
Xirveros: Blue people! Green people! Red people!
Frogman: Sure...\a Let's go there then.
Xirveros: Go? Go go? Go go go?
Frogman: ...I'm going, Xirveros. Are you coming?
Xirveros: Frog crazy!
...
Follow frog!
:hideCG:
:play:ToTheDeath
Frog? Bad monster here. Very bad.
Frogman: What monster?
Xirveros: Bad monster!\a Scary monster!\a Magic monster!
Frogman: Magic? Never seen that before here.
Xirveros: Magic rare! Magic bad! Magic painful!
Frogman: Uh... Sure...\a Let's go defeat it then.
Xirveros: Frog crazy!
...
Follow frog!

~ PreAlone
:play:BeforeBattle
:showCG:FortressPreview
Frogman: I'm all alone again... Wait, what is that thing?
Wow. It's a huge underground fortress!
I guess I'll go there.
# TBA: add Kresla or Firbell (de[ending on who died)

:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: What is this-\a Ugh, I'm talking to myself.\a I need to stop that.

~ PreAfterFail
:play:ToTheDeath
Frogman: You again. This time, I won't lose.

~ PostFirbell
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
:play:SafeAndSound
Firbell: Frogman, wait. We should not go that far.
Frogman: Huh? Why not?
Firbell: The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters become.\a Like that Lich we just fought.\a We should stick close to where we were Born.
Frogman: Sure, there might be tough enemies ahead.
But we're immortal, so we might as well fight them.
Firbell: We could just survive as long as we can.\a This is what I have done thus far.
Frogman: I'm sorry, but that sounds pointless.
I cannot accept a life of endless,\a pointless survival.\a There must be more here.\a Maybe even a way out.
Firbell: Getting out of here is impossible.\a But if you insist on seeing it for yourself, fine.
# TBA - improve

~ PostKresla
Kresla: Oh.\a It just disintegrated.\a What a shame.
Frogman: Kresla, we need to get out of here now!
Kresla: No, wait!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
:play:SafeAndSound
Frogman! Wait up!
Before you go on, you should know that there will be\a tougher enemies ahead.
Frogman: How do you know that?
Kresla: Through trial and error, of course!\a The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters become,\a like the Lich.
That's why people like me tend to stay near where we're Born.
Frogman: I didn't expect that from you, the fearless scholar.
Kresla: Unforunatly, bravery alone isn't enough to beat stronger\a monsters, like the Lich.\a But with our powers combined,\a we can be unstoppable!
Frogman: Yes. So let's go.

~ PostXirveros
Frogman: That was tough. Let's get out of here now!
:loadMap:InitTormentRoom
:loadUnits:InitTormentRoom:player
:play:SafeAndSound
Xirveros: Frog! Turn back. Now. This too far!
Frogman: Why would I do that?
Xirveros: They will come. You will fight.\a We will die.
Frogman: Xirveros, you're not making any sense.
Xirveros: Frog, don't make my mistake.
Turn back before it's too late.
Frogman: But why? What will happen?
Xirveros: Do not listen. Do not listen. Do no listen.
Frogman: Why do I even bother? Let's just go.

~ PostGeneric
Frogman: That was tough! I'm sorry, everyone.
I'll just have to go on without you.
