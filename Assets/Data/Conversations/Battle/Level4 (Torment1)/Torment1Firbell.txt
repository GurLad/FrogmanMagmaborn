Torment: Missed me, Frogman? Heh heh!
Frogman: Why do you keep doing this to my friends?
Torment: Friends?! HA HA HA! That's so precious, coming from you!\a Why, are you the one keeping them alive?\a Protecting them?\a Preserving their sanity? Heh heh!
Frogman: At least I'm not trying to kill them!\a And Xirveros is far from sane!
Torment: But this isn't about him, is it?\a He deserved it! Ha ha!\a This is about Firbell here!

Frogman: What are you talking about?
Torment: Didn't you figure it out? What a fool. Heh!\a Firbell's mind is so fragile,\a you'd have cracked it a dozen times if not for me!\a Ha ha ha!
Frogman: I don't know what you're talking about!
Torment: Oh, really? Let me tell you then.\a Why, her family was so thoroughly betrayed,\a it's beautiful! Ha Ha Ha!

Frogman: What?
Torment: You died in the middle of our conversations.\a That's quite rude, you know. Heh.
Frogman: What are you talking about?
