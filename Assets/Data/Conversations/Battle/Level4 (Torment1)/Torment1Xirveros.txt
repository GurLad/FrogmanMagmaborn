And you have Xirveros with you, I see!\a An obediant dog once again. Ha!
Frogman: What is Xirveros to do with anything?
Torment: What isn't Xirveros to do with? Ha ha!\a Didn't he ever tell you?
Frogman: Tell me what?
Torment: Right, he probably can't, can he?
:play:Trickster:T
He used to help me too, just like you! Heh!
Frogman: What?!
Torment: Tried to betray me at the end! It was...\a Fantastic! Ha ha ha!\a I broke his already fragile mind then.\a Can't have you be too independent, you know.\a Heh.
Frogman: Is this a threat?

Frogman: N-no!\a Please don't!\a I'd never betray you!
Torment: HA HA HA!!! As if!
But nevertheless, I do enjoy our conversations. Heh!
