Torment: It IS me again, heh heh!
And you have Xirveros with you, I see!\a An obedient dog once again. Ha!
Frogman: What is Xirveros to do with anything?
Torment: What isn't Xirveros to do with? Ha ha!\a Didn't he ever tell you?
Frogman: Tell me what?
Torment: Right, he probably can't, can he?
:play:Trickster:T
He used to help me too, just like you! Heh!
Frogman: What?!
Torment: Tried to betray me at the end! It was...\a Fantastic! Ha ha ha!\a I broke his already fragile mind then.\a Can't have you be too independent, you know.\a Heh.
Frogman: Is this a threat?

It felt almost... on purpose, don't you think?

Frogman: N-no, it definitely wasn't.
Torment: Oh, so you admit to being a fool, then?
Frogman: I am not a fool!

Torment: Oh? You claim that I'M the problem here?\a What insolence! Should I break your mind, then?\a Like Xirveros? Hm?
Frogman: I-
Torment: Ponder this question while you fight, Frogman.\a And try to win this time.\a Otherwise, I might get... paranoid.\a Heh heh heh.

Torment||R: Ooh, you're so much more interesting when fighting\a instead of talking! Heh heh!
Frogman: You... This... I...
Torment: See? That's much better now! Ha ha!\a Maybe I should break your mind too.\a Hm...
Frogman: N-no!\a Please don't!\a I'd never betray you!
Torment: HA HA HA!!! As if!
But nevertheless, I do enjoy our conversations. Heh!
