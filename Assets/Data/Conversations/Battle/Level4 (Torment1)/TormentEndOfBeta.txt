Torment|Dev: Unfortunatly, this is where your journey ends.\a As in, this is the last level in the demo!\a But there's still more content in it -\a more conversations, more maps and more upgrades.\a Also, check out Frog Forge if you haven't yet!
Oh, and please send us feedback,\a on the Steam forums or GitHub!\a Anyway, enough talk - DIE!!!
