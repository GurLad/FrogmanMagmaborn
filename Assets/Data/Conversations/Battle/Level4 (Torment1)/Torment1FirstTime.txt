Frogman: H-How many more are there?!
Torment: There's no need to panic, Frogman. That's quite enough.

Frogman: Is it... over?
Torment: Oh, yes it is! And it was simply...\a Exquisite! Fantastic! Beautiful!
I can sense an incredible... partnership coming up! Ha ha!
Frogman: Partnership? Are you crazy?!\a We would never help the likes of you!
Torment: Are you sure about that? Try again!
:screenShake:
Frogman: AHHHHHHH!
:screenShake:
AHHHHHHH!
:screenShake:
AHHHHHHH!
...
Torment: Now, now. There's no need for violence. Ha.\a We both seek the same thing, see?
Getting out of here. I'm trapped, just like you.
So we could just help each other, yes? Heh.\a A mutual partnership,\a between two prisoners. Ha!
Frogman: T-Trapped? Who... could even do such a thing?
Torment: The most wretched creatures of all - humans!\a They built their hideous little fortress,\a and trapped me in this miserable cave!\a I will make them SUFFER! HA HA HA!
Frogman: What do you... need us for?\a You're... obviously quite p-powerfull...
Torment: Flattery will get you nowhere. Heh.\a While I retained some of my power here,\a I cannot enter nor affect the Fortress.\a But you are... excempt from that magic. Ha.
You will enter the Fortress, and free us both, yes?
Frogman: I'll... think about-
:screenShake:
AHHHHHHH!
...O-of course we will...
Torment: Ha ha ha! That's the spirit!

I would give a little parting gift, but you already have it!\a That's all right. I'm not offended...\a Heh.
Off you go, then!
