Torment: Hello again, Frogman! Long time no see! Heh heh.
Frogman: Ugh. Hello, Torment.
Torment: Why the sour face? Heh.\a You've met a new friend recently,\a haven't you?
Frogman: You... mean Xeplogi?
Torment: But of course! Ha ha ha! I love that guy.\a He's just so punchable, isn't he?\a Heh heh.
Frogman: I'm not sure he'd appreciate being called that.
Torment: Ha! Tell him that for me, will you?\a But that's not important right now.\a How did you find the Guards, Frogman?
Frogman: Are they the humans who trapped you?\a They didn't seem particularly smart,\a nor magical...
:play:Trickster:T
Torment: Those pathetic creatures?! Of course not!\a They're mere pawns for the true humans: the Magi.\a And the Magi are... well, you will see for yourself.\a Heh.

Frogman: I've already met them. They do seem quite powerful.
Torment: Oh, you have? I mean, I knew that, of course!\a Heh heh.
