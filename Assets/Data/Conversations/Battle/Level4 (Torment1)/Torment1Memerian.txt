Torment||R: Why, hello there, Frogman! I've missed you. Heh heh.
Frogman: You have?
Torment: I was recently reminded of your predecessor. Memerian.\a She is such a bore, isn't she?\a Dull as a rock! Ha ha ha!
Frogman: Predecessor?
Torment: Yes. She was my previous champion.\a Firbell and Xirveros fought with her for a while.\a But then she grew... uncooperative. Heh.
Frogman: Uncooperative?
Torment: She stopped attempting to reach the fortress.\a In fact, she always stayed far from it.\a And that simply wouldn't do.\a After all, how would I escape without you pawns to help me?\a Ha ha ha!
Frogman: How?
:play:Trickster
Torment: That... was rhetorical, Frogman. Heh.
But we've reached an agreement, in the end.
She would keep fighting the Guards,\a and I'd keep her mind intact.\a Until you came along, and her services became...\a obsolete. Ha ha ha!
Frogman: Obsolete?
Torment: There was no more need for her to lead the Magmaborn. Heh.\a So I erased the memories of her former friends.\a Except Xeplogi.\a Their interactions are just so...\a entertaining, wouldn't you agree? Ha!
Frogman: Entertaining?

You're ruining my monologue with your daft questions!\a Ha ha ha!
