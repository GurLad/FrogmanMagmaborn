Lieutenant: Brens! Werse! I-I bring dire news!
Brens: Dire?! Out with it, soldier!
Werse||R: ...
Lieutenant: I-it's Fashima... She didn't...
Brens: She didn't what?!
Lieutenant: She didn't make it, masters.
Werse: ...Serves her right.
Brens||R: Oh. Oh no. So the Magmaborn...
Lieutenant: Will be here any moment now.
Brens: ...This is terrible. It's been centuries since...\a Werse, go alert Bodder.\a And Lessy.
Maybe this will finally drive her to do something.
Werse: ...As you wish. But Lessy is a lost cause.\a She never leaves her chamber anymore.
Brens: Ugh. I know. Yet we must try!\a I'll hold the Magmaborn here. Werse, go!
Werse: Wait, what? No, you're not a fighter!\a If they got through Fashima, they'll tear you to shreds!
Brens: ...It is our duty to die for humanity, Werse.\a Never forget that.
Werse: No. Our duty is to protect them, not die for them!\a Brens, please! Don't sacrifice yourself!
Brens: Ha. You're a good kid, Werse.\a But we don't have time for this.\a Go alert the remaining Magi.
Werse: Brens! You don't have to die! I beg you!
Brens: Werse, enough with this whining! Go alert the Magi at once!\a That's an order!
Werse: I...\a As you say, master.

Brens: ...I'm sorry, Werse. But I will fulfill my duty.
Soldiers! Listen up! Our worst fears have materialized.\a The Magmaborn are coming again.\a They managed to break through our walls.\a They killed Fashima.\a Yet we must not despair!\a We must protect the clone vats!\a We must protect the crystals!\a We must protect humanity!\a This is our sworn duty.\a It is time to fullfill it.\a Guards - assemble!

Firbell: These... are homes, Frogman.
Frogman: Yes, I know. This must be where the Guards live.
Firbell: Killing them here would be... brutal.
Frogman: ...You're right. But what choice do we have?\a We've come this far.\a We can't go back now.\a And they're on the way to teh center.
Firbell: It is never too late, Frogman. We should return.\a Go back to... before all of this.\a Fighting mindless monsters, not humans.
Frogman: It is too late now, Firbell.\a I'm sorry. But I'm not going back.
Firbell: ...Then I must-
Frogman: Abandon us? Your friends? Your comrades?\a Would that be just, Firbell?
Firbell: N-no, but-
Frogman: This is no time to second-guess our actions, Firbell.\a We need you here, Firbell.\a Are you with us?
Firbell: ...
Fine, Frogman.
Frogman: Good. Let's go!
Firbell: ...
How did this happen...?

Kresla: Oh my! They must be living in these houses!\a But where do they grow food?\a Or water?\a Or do they import it from the surface?\a And why-
Frogman: Kresla. We don't have time for this.
Kresla: You never give me time to explore, Frogman!
Frogman: Because we're surrounded by enemies!
Kresla: Fine, fine. But after this battle, I'm staying here!\a I must know how they work!
Frogman: ...Ugh, all right, Kresla.
Kresla: Great!

Oh well, let's break through!
