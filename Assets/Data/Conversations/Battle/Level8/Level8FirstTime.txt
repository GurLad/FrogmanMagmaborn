Lieutenant: Brens! Werse! I-I bring dire news!
Brens: Dire?! Out with it, soldier!
Werse||R: ...
Lieutenant: I-it's Fashima... She didn't...
Brens: She didn't what?!
Lieutenant: She didn't make it, masters.
Werse: ...Serves her right.
Brens||R: Oh. Oh no. So the Magmaborn...
Lieutenant: Will be here any moment now.
Brens: ...This is terrible. It's been centuries since...\a Werse, go alert Bodder.\a And the Crystal Magus.\a Maybe this will finally drive her to do something.
Werse: As you wish. But the Crystal Magus is a lost cause.
Brens: Ugh. I know. Yet we must try!\a I'll hold the Magmaborn here. Werse, go!
Werse: Wait, what? No, you're not a fighter!\a If they got through Fashima, they'll tear you to shreds!
Brens: ...It is our duty to die for humanity, Werse.\a Never forget that.
Werse: No, our duty is to protect them, not die for them!\a Brens, please! Don't sacrifice yourself!
Brens: Ha. You're a good kid, Werse.\a But we don't have time for this.\a Go alert the remaining Magi.
Werse: Brens! You don't have to die! I beg you!
Brens: Werse, enough with this whining! Go alert the Magi at once!\a That's an order!
Werse: ...As you say, master.

Soldiers! Listen up! Our worst fears have materialized.\a The Magmaborn are coming again.\a They managed to break through our walls.\a They killed Fashima.\a Yet we must not despair!\a We must protect the clone vats!\a We must protect the crystals!\a We must protect humanity!\a This is our sworn duty.\a It is time to fullfill it.\a Guards - assemble!
