Lieutenant: Brens! Werse! I-I bring dire news!
Brens: Dire?! Out with it, soldier!
Werse||R: ...
Lieutenant: I-it's Fashima... She didn't...
Brens: She didn't what?!
Lieutenant: She didn't make it, masters.
Werse: No...
Brens||R: Oh. Oh no. So the Magmaborn...
Lieutenant: Will be here any moment now.
Brens: ...This is terrible. It's been centuries since...\a Werse, go alert Bodder.\a And Lessy.
Maybe this will finally drive her to do something.
Werse: ...As you wish. But Lessy is a lost cause.\a She never leaves her chamber anymore.
Brens: Ugh. I know. Yet we must try!\a I'll hold the Magmaborn here. Werse, go!
Werse: Wait, what? No, you can't. You're not a fighter.
If they got through Fashima, they'll tear you to shreds!
Brens: It is our duty to die for humanity, Werse.\a Never forget that.
Werse: No. Our duty is to protect them, not die for them!\a Their lives aren't more important than ours!
Brens: What about the other Guards, then?\a Is my life more important than theirs?
Werse: I...
Brens: Ha. You're a good kid, Werse.\a But we don't have time for this.\a Go alert the remaining Magi.
Werse: Brens! Please reconsider!
Brens: Werse, enough with this whining! Go alert the Magi at once!\a That's an order!
Werse: I...\a As you say, master.

Brens: ...I'm sorry, Werse. But I will fulfill my duty.
Soldiers! Listen up! Our worst fears have materialized.\a The Magmaborn are back.\a They managed to break through our walls.\a They've killed Fashima.\a And yet, we shall not despair!\a We must protect the clone vats.\a We must protect the crystals.\a We must protect humanity!\a This is our solemn duty, and it is time to fulfill it!

Frogman: Kresla. We don't have time for this.
Kresla: You never give me time to explore, Frogman!
Frogman: Because we're surrounded by enemies!
Kresla: Fine, fine. But after this battle, I'm staying here!\a I must know how they work!
Frogman: ...Ugh, fine.
Kresla: Great! Now let's get rid of these pesky people!
