Lan: Ow! Let me go! You're... hurting me!
Werse: Stop struggling, and I'll let you go.
Lan: This is unfair! I could've... beat them!\a Why... why did you stop me?!
Werse: No, you couldn't. You would've died.\a And we can't afford to lose you. Not now.
Lan: No, no, no! You're wrong! I... I was just getting warmed up!\a I can beat them! I'm... better than them!
Werse: Oh, just shut up and let me treat your wounds.
Lan: I will not- Ah! Argh! Oof!
Werse: There you go. This should be enough to keep you alive.
Lan: Ah... I feel... tired... What have... you...
Werse: [Name:Guard1]?
Guard1: Yes, master?
Werse: Take this one to his room.
He should remain asleep for a few more hours.
Guard1: Yes, master!
