Werse: I'm back.
Brens: How did it go? Has Bodder finally decided to help us?
Werse: I'm afraid not. But I did manage to get an audience.
Brens: Really? What did she say?!
Werse: She got mad at me for breaking into her chamber,\a and dismissed me immediately afterwards.\a She refused to listen to reason,\a even after I told her that Fashima is already dead.
Brens: Hold on. You broke into her chamber?!
Werse: Yes. But that's not-
Brens: Have you lost your mind?! She is our leader!\a You... you can't do that!
Werse: Our leader? When was the last time you saw her, Brens?
Brens: Uh...
Werse: She hasn't been leading us for ages now!\a Someone had to do something about it!\a Had I not seen her myself today,\a I would've assumed she abandoned us completely!
Brens: That is no excuse! She must have her reasons!\a We are not to question her orders,\a let alone break into her chamber!
Werse: Why? What has she done to earn our respect?!
Brens: She has been our leader for longer than you've been alive!\a You have no right to doubt her!
Werse: I- Ugh, that's not even my point!\a When I saw her, something was off.\a She was too agitated, too quick-tempered.\a She didn't even talk her usual self.
Brens: Of course she was angry - you broke into her chamber!\a And that situation is highly unusual!\a How many times have you even met her,\a to know so well how she talks like?
Werse: ...Only a few times, and yet-
Brens: Enough with this nonsense! Werse, you're dismissed!\a Go home and take a rest.\a I'll let the incident today slide,\a but it better not happen again!
Werse: But-
Brens: Werse!
Werse: ...I apologize, master. I shall never do it again.
Brens: Good.

Lieutenant: The M-Magmaborn... They're back...
Brens: Back? Where?!
Lieutenant: They s-should be here in a few moments...
Brens: A few moments? Why didn't you say something earlier?!
Lieutenant: I d-didn't want to i-interrupt you...
Brens: You- Ugh, no matter! Get ready, everyone!
