Lieutenant: Master Brens! The Magmaborn! They're back!
Brens: Back at the wall? How is Lan holding up?
Lieutenant: N-no, they... they managed to defeat him, master.
Brens: Defeat?! Oh no. Not again... We can't replace him!\a What are we supposed to do?!

Werse: Don't worry about Lan. He managed to retreat in time.\a He's fine.
Brens: Werse? Where were you? How do you know that?
Werse: I've been watching the battle.
Brens: Watching? That's dangerous, Werse!\a We can't afford to lose you!
Werse: I can take care of myself, Brens.\a Besides, I remained invisible.
Brens: Good, good.
Lieutenant: Uh... The Magmaborn are getting close...
Brens: Right! Werse, get out of here! I'll handle them!
Werse: This again?
Brens: Lessy didn't respond per usual,\a and Bodder refused to leave the vats.\a That's what you said.
Werse: True, but I can fight them in your stead.\a I'm the better fighter, and you know it.
Brens: No. You're my apprentice, Werse.\a It's my duty to protect the city, not yours.
Werse: Then let me fight alongside you.
Brens: That's against our rules, and you know it.
Werse: What good are rules and duty for us now?!\a Fashima is dead!\a The Magmaborn are in our city!\a They don't care about our rules!
Brens: But I do, Werse! They exist for a reason!\a Now, leave this place!\a That's an order!
Werse: ...Please don't sacrifice yourself, Brens.
Werse: I won't. Now go!
