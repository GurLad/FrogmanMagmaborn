Guard1: ...
Uh, sir?
Lieutenant: Yes?
Guard1: What is up with Werse?
They've been gone for a few hours already,
and we're just standing here for no real reason.
Lieutenant: It's just the way they are. You'll get used to it.
Guard1: But... why? What's the point? It seems pretty dum-
Lieutenant: Shh! Don't say that!
Guard1: What? They're not here to hear it, are they?
Lieutenant: They can turn invisible, you know.\a They could be listening to us right now!
Guard1: I-invisible?!

Werse: Yes.
Lieutenant: Master! It's good to see you!
Werse: You too, [Name:Lieutenant]. And [Name:Guard1] as well.\a You're quite new here, correct?
Guard1: C-correct, master! I-I'm terribly sorry, I didn't-
Werse: It's quite all right, [Name:Guard1].\a Your curiosity is commendable.
However, we don't have time for idle chatter.
The Magmaborn are on their way here as we speak.
Guard1: M-Magmaborn?!
Werse: Yes. Get ready. And try to stay alive.
Guard1: Y-yes, master!
