Werse: You're awfully cooperative today.\a I didn't even have to put you to sleep.
Lan: I can't win against the Magmaborn, can I?
Werse: Hm. Colour me surprised. No, you can't. No one can.
Lan: Then why... why do we keep fighting, Werse?\a What's the point?
Werse: We have to protect humanity. That is our...\a duty...
Lan: Ha. Never thought I'd see the day where you talk about duty.\a Wasn't that Brens' thing?
Werse: It was...
Lan: Then why are you talking about it, eh? What's your reason?
Werse: ...I can't abandon the Guards.\a And they... they would never abandon their duty. And...\a this is what Brens would've wanted.
Lan: Hmpf. I never did care much for the Guards.\a Or the old man.
Werse: Then why are you fighting the Magmaborn?
Lan: I... I want to be the best.\a To be better than Fashima.\a Than you, and Bodder, and Leshy.
Werse: ...Seriously?
Lan: Yeah. But if none of you can beat the Magmaborn,\a then why should I try, eh?\a You're already not better than me!
Werse: ...
Lan: Why, I can just stop trying to beat the Magmaborn,\a and get better at other stuff!\a You can waste your time trying to do the impossible all you want -\a I'm going to become the best fisherman in the world!
Werse: ...I have no words for your idiocity.
Lan: Oh, just you wait till you see my amazing fishing skills!\a I'm simply the best!
Werse: I can't believe I thought for a moment you were redeemable.\a [Name:Guard1]?
Guard1: Yes, master?
Werse: Take this one to his quarters.\a I shall instil some sense in him late.
Guard1: Yes, master!
