Frogman: Firbell. What was that weird energy ball?
Firbell: What are you talking about?
Frogman: The cyan, crazy thing we fought last time.
Firbell: I do not remember such a thing. Are you okay?
Frogman: Huh. They really are rather powerful...
Firbell: Please do not go crazy on me.\a I would rather not have another Xirveros.
Frogman: Don't worry, I'm not going crazy.\a Listen to me.
Beyond the Lich, there is a crazed, laughing energy ball,\a named Torment. They are incredibly powerful,\a and they're trapped here, like us.
Firbell: ...Seriously?
:play:Trustworthy
Torment||R: Yes, seriously, Frogman. Who would buy such a story?\a Heh heh!
Frogman: You! Here, do you see now, Firbell?
Firbell||L: ...
Torment: HA HA HA! Ever the fool, are you, Frogman? Heh!
I think I made it pretty clear our agreement was...\a confidential, didn't I? Ha!
Frogman: You...
Torment: And yet, you betrayed me so easily? I'm offended! Heh.\a But everything comes with a price.\a And the price of betrayal is...\a DEATH! HA HA HA!
