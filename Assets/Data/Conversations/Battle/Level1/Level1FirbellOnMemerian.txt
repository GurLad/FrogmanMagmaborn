Firbell: Hello, Frogman.
Frogman: Oh, hi, Firbell.
Firbell: That golem we met last time... Memerian...\a I feel like I know her.
Frogman: Really?
Firbell: Yes, but it does not make any sense...\a What is wrong with me?
Frogman: Firbell? Are you okay?
:play:Trustworthy
Torment: Nope. She's got a bad case of faulty memory erasure.\a Heh.
Frogman: Torment?!
Torment: Missed me? Ha!\a Don't worry, I'll leave again soon.\a Heh.
Frogman: What are you doing this time?!
Torment: Fixing my past mistakes, of course! I can't have the...\a normal Magmaborn remembering my previous champions, right?\a Ha ha ha!
Frogman: You... erased Firbell's memeory?
Torment: Nothing so drastic. Only a small portion of it! Heh!\a But do not trouble your feeble mind -\a both of you shall forget all of that soon.
Frogman: You can erase memories?!
Torment: ...I forget how slow you are sometimes.\a Yes, Frogman.\a I can erase memories. Ha!\a But you must die first. After all,\a touching the memories of the living would be so...\a rude, wouldn't you agree?\a Heh heh heh!
