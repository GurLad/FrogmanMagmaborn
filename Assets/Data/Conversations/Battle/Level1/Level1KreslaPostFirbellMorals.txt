Kresla: Oh, hi, Frogman! How are you doing?
Frogman: Hey. I'm fine. You?
Kresla: Hm, you're thinking about something, I can tell!\a What is it? Did you discover something new?!
Frogman: No, it's... complicated.\a Have you seen Firbell?
Kresla: Firbell? No. It's been forever since the last time I saw her,\a you know.
Frogman: Yes. Uh, do you remember your last interaction?
Kresla: Not really.
I think she got really mad at something I said?
Frogman: Oh.
Kresla: Why are you asking all these questions?\a Wait, is Firbell avoiding you too?!
Frogman: I think so...
Kresla: Oh my! What did you say?
Frogman: It's a long story, and we have monsters to fight here.
Kresla: Right. But afterwards, you're definitely telling me!

Kresla: So! What happened with Firbell?
Frogman: She wanted us to stop trying to reach the Fortress.
Kresla: What? Why?
Frogman: She said that attacking the Guards isn't honorable.
Kresla: I see!
I do remember that she kept talking about honor all the time!\a I wonder what's the deal with her kingdom and honor.
Frogman: Yeah... Well, it doesn't really matter anymore.\a Let's just go.
Kresla: What? There's a lot to discuss here!\a Where are you going?!
