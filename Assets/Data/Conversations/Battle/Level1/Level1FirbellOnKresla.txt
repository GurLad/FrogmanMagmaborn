Firbell: We meet again, Frogman.
Frogman: Hello.\a I've been thinking lately.\a Why is it that I never see you with Kresla?
Firbell: I do not like her. ...Let us defeat this monsters,\a and then I will explain.
Frogman: Right.

Frogman: Well, that was that.\a So why do you not like Kresla?
Firbell: She has insulted Irenhold, Xirveros, and me.\a I tend to avoid her.
Frogman: Oh. What did she do?
Firbell: She claimed that Irenhold no longer exists.
Frogman: ...
Firbell: Preposterous, I know.\a But she could not be dissuaded.\a I cannot stand such insolance.
Frogman: So you avoid her?
Firbell: What choice do I have? Killing her has no effect.
I wonder how could she even get a Magma Emblem.
Frogman: I... see.
Firbell: But worry not, I am not offended by you fighting\a alongside her.\a That is your own bad choice.
Frogman: Thank you?
