Kresla: Hello Frogman! Care to be my test subject?
Frogman: No, thank you.\a Do you have to ask this every single time?
Kresla: Ha! No, but it's fun!
Frogman: *sigh* I've been meaning to ask.\a Why is it that I never see you with Firbell?
Kresla: I have no idea, actually. I never thought about it.
But now that you mention it, it IS wierd.\a Interesting!
Frogman: My thoughts too. But we should defeat the monsters first.
Kresla: Right, right.

Kresla: So, what do you propose we do?
Frogman: How about asking her?
Kresla: Nah, too boring. I say we ambush her!\a Ohh! Maybe pretend to be monsters, and then\a reveal our true identities before she kills us!
Or after!
Frogman: ...Remind me to never follow your advice.
Kresla: What?! Why? They're excellent!\a All right, hear this - Maybe we borrow...
Where are you going? Wait for me!
