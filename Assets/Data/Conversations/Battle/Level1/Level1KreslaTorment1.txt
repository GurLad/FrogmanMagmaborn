Frogman: Kresla. What was that weird energy ball?
Kresla: Are you talking about Lich magic?\a It's very interesting indeed!\a I've found no record-
Frogman: No, not magic. A cyan, crazy thing we fought last time?
Kresla: Seems interesting! Was it a hallucination?\a What did you see?
Frogman: No, I'm certain it was real...\a Huh. They really are rather powerful...
Kresla: I've no idea what're you talking about,\a but I'd love to research that!\a Do you remember when it happened? Where?
Frogman: Yes. Beyond the Lich, there was a crazed, laughing energy ball,\a named Torment. They are incredibly powerful,\a and they're trapped here, like us.
Kresla: Wow. Uh... I don't know what to say.
:play:Trustworthy
Torment||R: Yes, seriously, Frogman. Who would buy such a story?\a Heh heh!
Frogman: You! Here, do you see now, Kresla?
Kresla||L: ...
Torment: HA HA HA! Ever the fool, are you, Frogman? Heh!
I think I made it pretty clear our agreement was...\a confidential, didn't I? Ha!
Frogman: You...
Torment: And yet, you betrayed me so easily? I'm offended! Heh.\a But everything comes with a price.\a And the price of betrayal is...\a DEATH! HA HA HA!
