Firbell: Hello there, Frogman.
Frogman: Well met, Firbell.
Firbell: Would you like to hear a joke?
Frogman: This better not be about-
Firbell: Actually, let us defeat these monsters first.
Frogman: Let's. And please forget the joke.

Firbell: What did the skeleton say to the frog?
Frogman: Don't you da-
:screenShake:
Firbell: Ahhh! A talking frog!

You do not seem amused.
Frogman: I am not. Who set this up? Kresla?\a I thought you were avoiding her.
Firbell: No, Xirveros told it to me.
He also told me to tell it to you.
Frogman: This must be Kresla's doing... Oh well, time to go.
