Kresla: Hey, Frogman!
Frogman: Hello.
Kresla: Did you hear my conversation with Alfred?
Frogman: Yes?
Kresla: What he said was extremely weird and exciting!\a I mean, Guards in Bomzing?\a Them being the ones who named it that?\a I've never heard about anything like this!\a I wonder what's the meaning of this. They obviously tried to hide something, but what? Their existence? Something else from that time? Is this related to magic? I mean, the only people here who know anything about magic are Xirveros and Firbell - who are also from a place I've never heard about before. Is it all connected? Or am I just grasping at straws? I should interrogate Alfred further! And if he won't talk, we can torture him! What do you think, Frogman?
Frogman: Wha- Uh, sure, sure. Let's do that.
Kresla: Great! Let's go, then!
Frogman: Go where?
Kresla: To Alfred. To interrogate and torture him.
Frogman: To do what now?!
:loadUnits::monster:T
Kresla: Interrogate Alfred! With torture!\a You agreed to this plan, remember?
Frogman: I-I did?!
Kresla: Obviously! Anyway, there's some pesky monsters here.\a Let's defeat them, and then torture Alfred!

Frogman: W-wait!\a ...How did I get into this?
