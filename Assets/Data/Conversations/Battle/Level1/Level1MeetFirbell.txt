Firbell|???: I have not seen you before.
Are you new here?
Frogman: Y-Yes? What is this place?\a What is going on?
Firbell|???: Ah. First of all, do not panic.\a You are dead.
Frogman: What?!
Firbell|???: Do you remember your previous life?
Frogman: No...
Firbell|???: Quite common. I will explain all in time.\a However, as you have probably noticed,\a we are surrounded by monsters.
Frogman: Monsters?!
Firbell|???: Yes. I do not have time to explain. Ready your bow.
Frogman: My b-bow?\a Right, I have a bow...\a Wait, what's your name?!
Firbell||L: Firbell.\a Now, let us begin!

Firbell: ...You are back.
Frogman: Ahhh!\a You!
Firbell: Yes. It is me again.\a You died rather quickly last time.
Frogman: What do you mean?! I'm dead! How am I here?!
Firbell: I told you.\a You were already dead before.
Frogman: I-\a Uh, right.\a So I'm immortal?!
Firbell: Quite so.\a But it is still preferable not to get killed\a if you can help it.
Frogman: I-I see...
Firbell: Do you remember your name already?
Frogman: I... Wait, yes, I do.\a I was called...\a Frogman.
Firbell: ...That is no name.
:loadUnits::monster:T
But we are out of time, Frogman.\a The monsters are back.\a Ready your bow.\a And try to stay alive this time.
Frogman: O-okay...

Frogman: Oh no... Firbell is dead...\a What am I to do?\a But what she said...\a Are we truly immortal?\a Why?\a And what were these monsters?
...
I'm talking to myself here. I should get out of here...
I guess I'll just pick a random direction.

Frogman: We've won... What were those things?
Firbell: Dead people. Like us.
Frogman: What do you mean? They were mindless beasts!
Firbell: Yes. We retain our mind using Emblems.\a You have one on you as well.
#:showCG:Emblem
Frogman: Huh? You mean this crystal thing?
Firbell: Yes, of course.
I have one too, as do all sapient beings here.
You have probably noticed it on my crown.
Frogman: Where is it from?
Firbell: Our previous lives.
Frogman: Do you remember your previous life?
Firbell: Of course I do. You will as well, soon enough.
I am princess Firbell of Irenhold,\a daughter of queen Kirmella and heir to the\a throne.
Frogman: Uh...\a Isn't it more likely someone else inherited the\a throne when you died?
Firbell: ...I am sorry, did you say something, frog?
:if:hasFlag:ToldFirbellName{
Never mind, we should leave this place before\a more monsters show up.

:else:{
By the way, you haven't told me your name yet.
Frogman: I... don't remember it.\a But I do remember being called...
Frogman.
Firbell: What? That is impossible.
We all remember our name when we are first Born.
Frogman: Born?
Firbell: Revive from the Magma.\a You are a strange case, Frogman.
Let us leave this place before more monsters show up.
