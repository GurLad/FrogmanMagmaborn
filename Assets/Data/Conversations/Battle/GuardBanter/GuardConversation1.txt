Guard1: Ah... The good ol' magma.\a Been too long since my last battle here.
Guard2: It's... It's so hot! How can you stand it?
Guard1: Don't worry, kid. You'll get used to it.
Just swim in there a bit more!
Guard2: What? Swim in the magma?!
Guard1: Of course!\a Why, don't you kids do it all the time?
How can you fight without knowing how to swim im magma?
Guard2: But i-it's dangerous!
Guard1: Are you this cowardly?!
Back in my day, EVERYONE swam in magma!
Guard2: But-
Guard1: No buts! After this battle, you'll go for a swim!
Guard2: A-all right...
