Memerian: I didn't come anywhere.
You are the ones who have approached me.
Xeplogi: Do not change the subject, you trickster!
Frogman: Xeplogi. Memerian.
How about we put our differences aside for now,\a and-
Memerian: No. I am not working with this slime.
Xeplogi: Ha! As if I would ever join forces with you!
Frogman: Ugh. Can you please stop this pointless bickering?
How long have you been fighting each other?
Memerian: Centuries, I'd wager.
Xeplogi: C-Centuries?! Don't be foolish! A year at most.
Memerian: Oh, really? And how would you know that, idiot?
You couldn't keep track of time even when you were alive.
Xeplogi: Why, you-
Frogman: You know what? This is pointless.\a You are clearly incapable of changing.
Enjoy killing each other for all eternity.
Xeplogi: I am not incapable of changing!\a I would gladly forgive Memerian,\a were she to apologize properly.
Memerian: You want ME to apologize?! You are the one who murdered me!
Xeplogi: See? She is clearly the problem here!
Memerian: ...You are unsalvageable, Xeplogi.
