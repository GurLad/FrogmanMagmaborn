Xeplogi: Ah. The deplorable Memerian shows her hideous face again.
Memerian: Ah. The deceitful thief dares insulting me.\a But I don't care for you, Xeplogi.\a Who are your friends there?
Xeplogi: Hmpf. None of your business.\a Now, get out of here, or suffer the consequences.
Memerian: Are you their boss?
Xeplogi: Uh-
Memerian: Didn't think so.\a So. Introcude yourselves.
Frogman: Um, I'm Frogman.

Xeplogi||L: T-that's enough! Stop talking to this trickster at once!
All she ever does is steal and betray!
Memerian: Ha! Oh, the irony. Have you no shame, Xeplogi?
Frogman: Uh, look, I'm not sure what's your issue,\a but shouldn't we work together against-
Memerian: Work together? He murdered me!
Xeplogi: She stole my Magma Emblem!
Memerian: You stole it from me first, you hypocrite!
Frogman: Uh-
Xeplogi||L: It was rightfully mine, you... you twister of truths!
Memerian: That's not even a real insult, you absolute liquid!
Xeplogi: Neither is that!
Frogman||L: Can you please-
Xeplogi: Why are you even trying to reason with her, Frogman?\a Was I not a good and trustworthy ally?
Memerian: Oh, please. You're about as good in combat as a tree.\a I, on the other hand,\a have actual experience fighting the Guards.\a And winning.
Frogman: Really?
Memerian: I've been to the Fortress. Multiple times.
Frogman: Seriously?! We've been trying to reach that place for ages!
Xeplogi: Yes. And we can still get there without her help.
Memerian||R: Ha! Good luck with that.
Xeplogi||R: W-why, you little-
Frogman: Ugh. Just stop, you two. Let me think.

Frogman: Yes. You've been there, right?\a Could you tell us a bit about what's inside?
Memerian: I don't know what's inside,\a but I can tell you what's outside. Guards.
Frogman: Wait. Didn't you say that you've been there before?
Memerian: I've been to the fortress. Not inside it.\a There's a difference.
Frogman: Right...
:if:hasCharacter:Firbell{
Firbell||L: Memerian. Do you know why do these Guards hate us so?
Memerian: They hate all monsters. In fact, from what I've gathered,\a all they ever do is killing monsters.

Memerian: No harm? Please. We've just killed a couple of them.
Firbell: I...\a I see your point.\a Still, I must try at the very least.
Memerian: You always do.
Firbell: What do you mean?
Memerian: Never mind me. Anyway, we should get out of here.\a Frogman?

Memerian: Alone? Good luck with that.
Kresla: No, no. I need you as bodyguards, after all.\a Now then, let's go!
:hideUnit:Kresla
Memerian: ...Heh. I like that one.
Frogman: She's a bit... reckless.
Memerian: You don't need to be afraid when your immortal, Frogman.

Memerian: Frogman. Now that we're alone, you need to know something.
Frogman: What is it?
}
Memerian: I used to help Torment, just like you.
Frogman: Really?!
Memerian: Yes. We had a... falling out eventually.\a But I see he has found a replacement already.
Frogman: What happened?
Memerian: I realized it was impossible.
Frogman: What was?
Memerian: Getting out of here.\a That fortress? It's impenetrable.
Frogman: I'm sure there's a way inside...
Memerian: That's not the problem. It doesn't even have a gate -\a anyone could theoretically enter it.
Frogman: Huh? Then what's the problem?
Memerian: The one guarding it. Assuming she's still alive.\a She's a wizard.
Frogman: Like Xirveros?
Memerian: ...Seriously?
Frogman: Yeah, that was a foolish question.\a Like the lich, then?
Memerian: Similar, but much more powerful. And intelligent.
She can teleport anywhere, and transform her appearance.\a Frankly, we don't stand a chance.
Frogman: Why are you helping me, then?
Memerian: Something must have changed.\a Torment has selected a new champion for a reason.\a I'd like to see it.
Frogman: I... see.
Memerian: Now that we're on the same page, let's leave this place.
Frogman: Right.
