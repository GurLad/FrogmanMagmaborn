~ MemerianConversation
Memerian: Hey. You're back.
Frogman: Yes.
Memerian: And alone. That's great.
Frogman: Great? Why?
Memerian: Something big is about to happen.\a And I'm not sure how some Magmaborn would react.\a I'd like to keep it between us.
Frogman: What are you talking about?
Memerian: It's Fashima. She's wearing a Magma Emblem.

:if:!hasFlag:FrogmanKnowsFashimasName{
Frogman: Who?
Memerian: ...Fashima. The Wall Magus?\s The one guarding the Fortress?
Frogman: Oh. How do you know her name?
Memerian: I fought her a lot in the past.\a I used to be Torment's champion before you, you know.
:setFlag:FrogmanKnowsFashimasName
:if:!hasFlag:MemerianMentionedTorment{
Frogman: You were? Wait, you know Torment?!
Memerian: Ugh. Did I really never tell you even that much?\a Never mind, that's not the point right now.\a As I've said, Fashima is wearing a Magma Emblem.\a Do you know what that means?
:setFlag:MemerianMentionedTorment
}
:else:{
Frogman: Ah, right.
Memerian: Anyway, that's not the point.\a As I've said, Fashima is wearing a Magma Emblem.\a Do you know what that means?
}
}
Frogman: A Magma Emblem?\a Wait.\a Does that mean that should we kill her,\a she'll return as a Magmaborn?!
Memerian: Exactly.
Frogman: Woah. That's...\a Huh.\a How do you even know that?
Memerian: I managed to get a close look at her necklace last time.\a It's one of the three Magma Emblems I made.
Frogman: You've made Magma Emblems?!
Memerian: Yes. Three in total: one I embedded in my hammer,\a another in a small pin -\a which was stolen by Xeplogi -\a and the last one in a necklace -\a the same one that Fashima currently wears.
Frogman: Wow.\a But isn't destroying all Magmaborn her goal?\a Becoming one seems... contrary.
Memerian: I know. It's quite the bold move on her part.\a She's either planning to defect to us,\a or try to destroy us from the inside.
Frogman: Destroying us? How would she even do that?
Memerian: I don't know. But be careful around her.\a She's not one to be trusted,\a even if she ends up becoming one of us.
Frogman: Right...
Memerian: Oh, and don't tell anyone else about it.
Frogman: Why not?
Memerian: You want to get out of here, right?
Frogman: Uh, yes?
Memerian: Some Magmaborn would...\a have reservations about creating another one,\a especially a Magus like her.\a If you want everyone to keep helping you,\a do the smart thing and keep it to yourself.
Frogman: Sure... Why are you telling me this, then?
Memerian: You seemed quite determined about getting out of here.\a I don't doubt this knowledge would stop you.
Frogman: Right...
