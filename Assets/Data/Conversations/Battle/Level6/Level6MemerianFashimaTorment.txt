Memerian: Frogman.
Frogman: Oh. Hi, Memerian.
Memerian: It's nice of you to come here alone.\a I've been meaning to talk to you about something.

Frogman: What is it? Wait, is it about Torment?
Memerian: Yes.
Frogman: Why do they let you remember them?

Frogman: What is it? Wait, is it about Xeplogi?
Memerian: What? Ugh, no. No, it's about Tormet.
Frogman: You know Torment?!
Memerian: Yes.
Frogman: Why do they let you remember them?

Memerian: I used to help Torment, just like you.
Frogman: Really?!
Memerian: Yes. We had a... falling out eventually.\a But I see he has found a replacement already.
Frogman: What happened?
Memerian: I realized it was impossible.
Frogman: What was?
Memerian: Getting out of here.\a That fortress? It's impenetrable.

Frogman: I'm sure there's a way inside...
Memerian: That's not the problem. It doesn't even have a gate -\a anyone could theoretically enter it.
Frogman: Huh? Then what's the problem?
Memerian: The one guarding it. Assuming she's still alive.\a She's a wizard.
Frogman: Like Xirveros?
Memerian: ...Seriously?
Frogman: Yeah, that was a foolish question.\a Like the lich, then?
Memerian: Similar, but much more powerful. And intelligent.
She can teleport anywhere, and transform her appearance.\a Frankly, we don't stand a chance.
Frogman: Why are you helping me, then?
Memerian: Something must have changed.\a Torment has selected a new champion for a reason.\a I'd like to see it.
Frogman: I... see. Wait, champion? What-
