Brens: Fashima.\a Fashima!\a Stop ignoring me, Fashima!\a Fashima!!!
Fashima_: ...Ugh. Will you please stop shouting, Brens?
Brens: I began shouting because you ignored me!
Fashima_: I ignored you because you never say anything interesting.
Brens: What's that supposed to mean?
Fashima_: Don't bother your feeble brain over it, Brens.
Brens: Feeble brain? Are you calling me stupid?!
Fashima_: Yes.
Brens: How dare you!
Fashima_: But it's true. I mean, you can't transform,\a you can't teleport...\a What are you even good for?
Brens: Not everyone needs to fight, Fashima!
I don't need transformation magic for logistics.\a Even you don't need it,\a and you're a warrior!
Fashima_: And yet, I still know how to use it.\a Why, had you known how to do that,\a you might have looked a lot better, grandpa.
Brens: Why do you keep goading me?! What did I ever do to you?
Fashima_: You exist. That's reason enough.
Brens: Wha- Ugh, fine. You don't want me here? I'll go.\a Take care, Fashima.
