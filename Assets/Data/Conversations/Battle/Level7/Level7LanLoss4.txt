I'm beautiful, I'm strong, I'm smart.\a I was chosen by Fashima.\a Fashima! The most powerful Magi ever!\a But I keep... I keep... Losing...\a To that... That Frogman...
Lieutenant: ...Lan?
Lan: What!
Lieutenant: Why are you talking to yourself?\a Are you quite all right?
Lan: All right?! Who do you think you are, eh? Leshy herself?!\a Get out of my sight!

Lan: Werse? What are you doing here?!
Werse: Making sure you don't get yourself killed.
Lan: I... I don't need your help! Go away!
Werse: Yes, you do.
You won't be able to fight the Magmaborn in this sorry state.
Lan: Sorry state?! I'm in the best state! The best!\a I... I can take them all!
Werse: Oh, really? Prove it to me.
Lan: Prove it? I don't have to prove anything to you!\a You're not my master!
Werse: Are you afraid you'll fail, then?
Lan: N-no! I'm not afraid! I'm the great Lan - I fear nothing!
Werse: Excellent. Then I shall be watching you battle.\a Don't dissapoint me.

# === Functions ====

~ LanDies
# This is an alternate version of the events I thought about implementing, but probably won't, as it requires too much work modifying all levels to account for Lan's death (as Werse would become the de-facto leader of all Guards and would order them to stop fighting the monsters & Magmaborn)
Lieutenant: Lan.\a I am relieving you of duty.
Guard1||L: ...! She's actually going through with this?!
Guard2||L: IS this real? Are we really getting rid of him?!
Lan: What... What did you just say?
Lieutenant: You are clearly unstable and unfit to lead.\a I have had enough of following you around.\a Surrender peacefully, and you might yet live.
Lan: You! How DARE you! I will have your head for this!
:screenShake:
YAHH!
Lieutenant: ...
Pathetic.
Lan: You... How are you still alive?
Lieutenant: Because you're weak, Lan.\a Always have been.\a And thank you for attacking me first.\a Now my retaliation is justified.

Lan: Arrgh!\a N-no... How...
