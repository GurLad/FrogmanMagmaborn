Memerian: Fashima.
Fashima_: Oh, Memerian. It's been a long time.\a Tired of playing it safe?
Memerian: What game are you playing at, Fashima?
Fashima_: The only game that matters. Stopping you.
Memerian: Oh, please. You could have killed us a dozen times by now.\a What are you waiting for?\a Unless...
Fashima_: I'm just having a little fun here, Memerian.\a I want to look into your eyes as you die.
Memerian: No. That necklace... Oh my.\a Things are about to get interesting.
Fashima_: Too bad you'll be dead by then.

Fashima_||R: You're new.
Frogman: Huh? You're talking to me?
Fashima_: Yes. Who else would I be talking to?
Frogman: Uh, it's just that no Guard has ever...
Fashima_: I'm not one of those pathetic Guards.\a I'm Fashima, the Wall Magus. Prepare to die.

Fashima_: Hm? Who are you?\a Wait a moment. Alfred?!
Alfred: Huh? How do you know me?!
Fashima_: You've changed since I killed you, Alfred,\a but I will always recognize your markings.
Alfred: You... You killed me?\a You're the traitor? Alfasher?!
Fashima_: I am the Wall Magus Fashima, now.
Alfred: ...Answer one question before I kill you, Fashima.\a Why did you betray us?\a Betray Boss?\a Why did you join the Guards?!
Fashima_: These are three questions, Alfred.\a Nevertheless, I shall humor you.\a I didn't betray Boss. He betrayed me.\a He stole my crystal.
Alfred: Pah! Boss would never do that! The Guards do that!
Fashima_: Boss was just a common street thug,\a abusing us kids to gain power and money.\a Of course he'd do that.
Alfred: Lies!\a Boss was a visionary!\a Just leader to replace the Guards!
Fashima_: Why did you ask about my reason for betrayal if you had\a no intention of listening to me?
Alfred: I thought you had a shred of honor.\a But you're a slimy liar.\a You'll die!
Fashima_: Someday, I will. But not today.

Kresla: Hey! Are you the leader of this bunch?
Fashima_: Yes. Who are you?
Kresla: Kresla, a renowned scholar.\a Could you explain this fortress to me?\a Why are you protecting it?\a What is its purpose?\a Why are you fighting us?
Fashima_: I see that the rumors about your fearlessness are correct.
Kresla: You've heard about me?!
Fashima_: Indeed. I must admit, I'm quite a fan.\a Your discoveries are legendary.\a Especially the Magma Emblem.
Kresla: You- Wait. How do you know about the Magma Emblem?
Fashima_: I used to be a friend of Kesper.\a Before he died, that is.
Kresla: Kesper? How-
Fashima_: As much as I'd like to chat, we have appearances to keep.
Kresla: Wait-
Fashima_: Silence, vermin! I am Fashima, the Wall Magus!\a Prepare to meet my wrath!

Xeplogi: I am Duke Xeplogi the Third of Jess.\a And who might you be?
Fashima_: Fashima, the Wall Magus. How long have you been here?
Xeplogi: Longer than you've been alive, my child! Oh ho ho!
Fashima_: I highly doubt that. Where did you get your Magma Emblem?
Xeplogi: ...I purchased it from Memerian.\a Legitimately.
Fashima_: Memerian? Yet I never saw you with her.
Xeplogi: Memerian?! I would never associate myself with such vermin!
Fashima_: I see. Nice talk, Xeplogi.\a Now die.

Xirveros: Me?
Fashima_: I never got the chance to thank you properly.\a Your notes about magic were quiet useful,\a and killing Kostliv was a tremendous help to me.
Xirveros: Kostliv? Ooh, you want Kostliv song?
Fashima_: It's truly a shame what Lessem and Torment did to you.
We could have made an incredible team together.
Xirveros: Kostliv on the wall        \w@
Hope he won't fall         \w@
Me fight with that Kostliv \w@
For he the target Tori give\w@

Fashima_: Oh, Firbell. Long time no see.
Firbell: ...I am sorry, but I do not recall ever seeing you before.
Fashima_: Makes sense.
Torment does have a tendency to wipe your memories.
Firbell: Excuse me?
Fashima_: Don't trouble yourself, child.\a You won't remember anything of this conversation soon,\a anyway.
Firbell: Is that a threat?
Fashima_: No. Threats are a waste of time.
