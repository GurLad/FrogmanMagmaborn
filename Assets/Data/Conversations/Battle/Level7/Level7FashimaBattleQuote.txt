Memerian: Fashima.
Fashima_: Oh, Memerian. It's been a long time.\a Tired of playing it safe?
Memerian: What game are you playing at, Fashima?
Fashima_: The only game that matters. Stopping you.
Memerian: Oh, please. You could have killed us a dozen times by now.\a What are you waiting for?\a Unless...
Fashima_: I'm just having a little fun here, Memerian.\a I want to look into your eyes as you die.
Memerian: No. That necklace... Oh my.\a Things are about to get interesting.
Fashima_: Too bad you'll be dead by then.

Fashima_: Yes. Who else would I be talking to?
Frogman: Uh, it's just that no Guard has ever...
Fashima_: I'm not one of those pathetic Guards.\a I'm Fashima, the Wall Magus. Prepare to die.

How much weight... can you handle?

Alfred: Can you withstand-
Fashima_: Stop. You must be Alfred.
Alfred: You... How do you know me?!
Fashima_: You've changed since I killed you, Alfred,\a but I will always recognize your markings.
Alfred: Kill... You! You're the traitor? Alfashima?!
Fashima_: Hah. Alfashima.
It's been millennia since anyone used that honorific.
Alfred: You... You don't deserve it! You betrayed us!\a Killed Boss! Killed me! Stole our crystals!\a Defected to the Guards!!!
Fashima_: You're calling me the traitor? How precious.\a Boss was the one who betrayed me.
Alfred: What?!
Fashima_: The crystal was mine. I recovered it.\a Yet he stole it from me.\a Left me for dead!\a The Guards saved me. Gave-\a They gave me a second chance.\a A chance to recover MY crystal.
Alfred: Pah! Boss would never do that!\a And the Guards save nobody!
Fashima_: Boss was just a common street thug, abusing us kids.
He filled our heads with nonsense,\a and used us to get crystals for himself.
Alfred: Lies! You lie! I'll kill you, traitor!
Fashima_: You're a lost cause, Alfred.\a Here, let me put you out of your misery.

Fashima_: Yes. Who are you?
Kresla: Kresla, a renowned scholar.\a Could you explain this fortress to me?\a Why are you protecting it?\a What is its purpose?\a Why are you fighting us?
Fashima_: I see that the rumors about your fearlessness are correct.
Kresla: You've heard about me?!
Fashima_: Indeed. I must admit, I'm quite a fan.\a Your discoveries are legendary.\a Especially the Magma Emblem.
Kresla: You- Wait. How do you know about the Magma Emblem?
Fashima_: I used to be a friend of Kesper.\a Before he died, that is.
Kresla: Kesper? How-
Fashima_: As much as I'd like to chat, we have appearances to keep.
Kresla: Wait-

Fashima_: Fashima, the Wall Magus. How long have you been here?
Xeplogi: Longer than you've been alive, my child! Oh ho ho!
Fashima_: I highly doubt that. Where did you get your Magma Emblem?
Xeplogi: ...I purchased it from Memerian.\a Legitimately.
Fashima_: Memerian? Yet I never saw you with her.
Xeplogi: I would never associate myself with such vermin!

Fashima_: I never got the chance to thank you properly.\a Your notes about magic were quiet useful,\a and killing Kostliv was a tremendous help to me.
Xirveros: Kostliv? Ooh, you want Kostliv song?
Fashima_: It's truly a shame what Lessem and Torment did to you.
We could have made an incredible team together.
Xirveros: Kostliv on the wall        \w@
Hope he won't fall         \w@
Me fight with that Kostliv \w@

Fashima_: Makes sense.
Torment does have a tendency to wipe your memories.
Firbell: Excuse me?
Fashima_: Don't trouble yourself, child.\a You won't remember anything of this conversation soon,\a anyway.
Firbell: Is that a threat?
