Lan: Yes, Brens?
Brens: How are you holding up?
Being the new Wall Magus must be quite tough.
Lan: Great! I'm doing great!
Brens: Really? Are you sure you're okay?\a Fashima died rather... suddenly.
Lan: Yeah. Who needs her, anyway?
Brens: That's no way to treat your former master!
Lan: Pfft. Don't tell me what to do!
Brens: I'm not-
Brens|Lan: Oh, oh, look at me! I'm Brens!\a I'm so smart and nice and good!\a I'm here because I worry about you,\a not becuase I'm a power-hungry idiot! No, sir!
Brens: Lan, this behaviour is quite unbecoming of a Magus!
Brens|Lan: Yeah, Lan! Be like me! Annoying as hell!
Brens: ...I'm going, Lan. Stay alive out there.
