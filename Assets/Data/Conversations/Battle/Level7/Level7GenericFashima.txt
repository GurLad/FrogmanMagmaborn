Memerian: Fashima.
Fashima_: Oh, Memerian. It's been a long time.\a Tired of playing it safe?
Memerian: What game are you playing at, Fashima?
Fashima_: The only game that matters. Stopping you.
Memerian: Oh, please. You could have killed us a dozen times by now.\a What are you waiting for?\a Unless...
Fashima_: I'm just having a little fun here, Memerian.\a I want to look into your eyes as you die.
Memerian: No. That necklace... Oh my.\a Things are about to get interesting.
Fashima_: Too bad you'll be dead by then.

Fashima_: Yes. Who else would I be talking to?
Frogman: Uh, it's just that no Guard has ever...
Fashima_: I'm not one of those pathetic Guards.\a I'm Fashima, the Wall Magus. Prepare to die.

Fashima_: Wow. I can't believe it.
You've been dead for so long,\a and now's the first time you've ever gotten close to me?\a Your incompetence truly is legendary.
Alfred: Who're you?!
Fashima_: Seriously? Don't you recognize me?
Alfred: You... Wait, your smell... Fasher? The traitor?!
Fashima_: I fear that Fasher's dead, Alfred.\a I am Fashima, the Wall Magus.
Alfred: He is?! No. No!\a But I must have my revenge!\a Argh...\a I will kill you instead!

Fashima_: Yes. Who are you?
Kresla: Kresla, a renowned scholar.\a Could you explain this fortress to me?\a Why are you protecting it?\a What is its purpose?\a Why are you fighting us?
Fashima_: I see that the rumors about your fearlessness are correct.
Kresla: You've heard about me?!
Fashima_: Indeed. I must admit, I'm quite a fan.\a Your discoveries are legendary.\a Especially the Magma Emblem.
Kresla: You- Wait. How do you know about the Magma Emblem?
Fashima_: I used to be a friend of Kesper.\a Before he died, that is.
Kresla: Kesper? How-

Fashima_: I highly doubt that. Where did you get your Magma Emblem?
Xeplogi: ...I purchased it from Memerian.\a Legitimately.
Fashima_: Memerian? Yet I never saw you with her.
