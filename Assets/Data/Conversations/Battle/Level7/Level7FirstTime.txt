Fashima_: What is it now, Brens?
Brens: Is it true? That there's another new Magmaborn?!
Fashima_: Yes.\a Took you long enough to realize that.
Brens: You knew? Why didn't you say anything?!\a It's your job to prevent such incidents!
Fashima_: Isn't it your job to take care of the city,\a instead of pestering me?
Brens: Don't change the subject!\a Are they dangerous?\a Will they try escaping?!
Fashima_: I don't know.
Brens: You don't know?!
Fashima_: Yes, I don't know.\a I'm not made of answers, you know.
Brens: Argh! This is a disaster!
Fashima_: Calm down, old man. Everything's under control.
Brens: Old man?! You're the oldest Magus alive!\a Ugh, I've had enough!\a Keep an eye on the wall while I'm gone.

Memerian||R: Indeed. It's entire purpose is to prevent us from leaving.\a And the monsters, of course.
Frogman: Did you ever get insider?
Memerian: No, never. They are always led by a powerfull mage.\a Fashima.\a She was way too strong.\a Annoying as hell, too.
Frogman: I see.\a Let's go defeat her, then.
Memerian: Defeat her? Pfft!
Our only hope is that she had died of old age by now.
Frogman: Was she truly that powerfull?
Memerian: She's a mage. She doesn't play fair.\a But enough chitchat - you'll see for yourself,\a soon enough.
Frogman: Right.
