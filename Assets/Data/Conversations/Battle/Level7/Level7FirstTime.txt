Fashima_: What is it now, Brens?
Brens: Is it true? That there's another new Magmaborn?!
Fashima_: Yes.\a Took you long enough to realize that.
Brens: You knew? Why didn't you say anything?!\a It's your job to prevent such incidents!
Fashima_: Isn't it your job to take care of the city,\a instead of pestering me?
Brens: Don't change the subject!\a Are they dangerous?\a Will they try escaping?!
Fashima_: I don't know.
Brens: You don't know?!
Fashima_: Yes, I don't know.\a I'm not made of answers, you know.
Brens: Argh! This is a disaster!
Fashima_: Calm down, old man. Everything's under control.
Brens: Old man?! You're the oldest Magus alive!\a Ugh, I've had enough!\a Keep an eye on the wall while I'm gone.

Frogman: Did you ever get insider?
Memerian: No, never. They are always led by a powerful mage.\a Fashima.\a She was way too strong.\a Annoying as hell, too.
Frogman: I see.\a Let's go defeat her, then.
Memerian: Defeat her? Pfft!
Our only hope is that she had died of old age by now.
Frogman: Was she truly that powerful?
Memerian: She's a mage. She doesn't play fair.\a But enough chitchat - you'll see for yourself,\a soon enough.
Frogman: Right.

Alfred: You... You killed me?\a You're the traitor? Fasher?!
Fashima_: I am the Wall Magus Fashima, now.
Alfred: ...Answer one question before I kill you, Fashima.\a Why did you betray us?\a Betray Boss?\a Why did you join the Guards?!
Fashima_: These are three questions, Alfred.\a Nevertheless, I shall humour you.\a I didn't betray Boss. He betrayed me.\a He stole my crystal.
Alfred: Pah! Boss would never do that! The Guards do that!
Fashima_: Boss was just a common street thug,\a abusing us kids to gain power and money.\a Of course he'd do that.
Alfred: Lies!\a Boss was a visionary!\a Just leader to replace the Guards!
Fashima_: Why did you ask about my reason for betrayal if you had\a no intention of listening to me?
Alfred: I thought you had a shred of honor.\a But you're a slimy liar.\a You'll die!

Kresla: You've heard about me?!
Fashima_: Indeed. I must admit, I'm quite a fan.\a Your discoveries are legendary.\a Especially the Magma Emblem.
Kresla: You- Wait. How do you know about the Magma Emblem?
