Fashima_: ...
Brens: Fashima, please.\a I have one last question,\a and then I'll never pester you again.
Fashima_: ...Make it a good one.
Brens: Ever since you returned from your surface trip, you've been...\a Cold. Even more than usual.\a And the Magmaborn? I've heard the stories.\a You used to slay them all in mere seconds.\a They never even had a chance to defeat us.\a But recently... They've gotten dangerously close to defeating you.
Fashima_: Get to the point, old man.
Brens: What happened outside?\a What changed you?
Fashima_: That's two questions. And it's none of your buisness.
Brens: Please, Fashima. We're allies. You can talk to me.
Fashima_: And yet, I don't want to. Leave me alone, Brens.\a Go take care of your precious city.
Brens: I-
Fashima_: Now.
Brens: ...Goodbye, Fashima. May you live forever.
Fashima_: Likewise.
