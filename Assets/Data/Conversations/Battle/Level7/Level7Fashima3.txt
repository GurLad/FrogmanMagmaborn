Fashima_: ...
Brens: Fashima, please.\a I have one last question,\a and then I'll never pester you again.
Fashima_: ...Make it a good one.
Brens: Ever since you returned from your surface trip, you've been...\a Cold. Even more than usual.\a And the Magmaborn? I've heard the stories.\a You used to slay them all in mere seconds.\a They never even had a chance to defeat us.\a But recently... They've gotten dangerously close to defeating you.
Fashima_: Get to the point, old man.
Brens: What happened outside?\a What changed you?
Fashima_: That's two questions. And it's none of your buisness.
Brens: Please, Fashima. We're allies. You can talk to me.
Fashima_: And yet, I don't want to. Leave me alone, Brens.\a Go take care of your precious city.
Brens: I-
Fashima_: Now.
Brens: ...Goodbye, Fashima. May you live forever.
Fashima_: Likewise.

Fashima_: Oh, Memerian. It's been a long time.\a Tired of playing it safe?
Memerian: What game are you playing at, Fashima?
Fashima_: The only game that matters. Stopping you.
Memerian: Oh, please. You could have killed us a dozen times by now.\a What are you waiting for?\a Unless...
Fashima_: I'm just having a little fun here, Memerian.\a I want to look into your eyes as you die.
Memerian: No. That necklace... Oh my.\a Things are about to get interesting.

Fashima_: You've changed since I killed you, Alfred,\a but I will always recognize your markings.
Alfred: You... You killed me?\a You're the traitor? Fasher?!
Fashima_: I am the Wall Magus Fashima, now.
Alfred: ...Answer one question before I kill you, Fashima.\a Why did you betray us?\a Betray Boss?\a Why did you join the Guards?!
Fashima_: These are three questions, Alfred.\a Nevertheless, I shall humour you.\a I didn't betray Boss. He betrayed me.\a He stole my crystal.
Alfred: Pah! Boss would never do that! The Guards do that!
Fashima_: Boss was just a common street thug,\a abusing us kids to gain power and money.\a Of course he'd do that.
Alfred: Lies!\a Boss was a visionary!\a Just leader to replace the Guards!
Fashima_: Why did you ask about my reason for betrayal if you had\a no intention of listening to me?
Alfred: I thought you had a shred of honor.\a But you're a slimy liar.\a You'll die!

Fashima_: I see that the rumors about your fearlessness are correct.
Kresla: You've heard about me?!
Fashima_: Indeed. I must admit, I'm quite a fan.\a Your discoveries are legendary.\a Especially the Magma Emblem.
Kresla: You- Wait. How do you know about the Magma Emblem?
Fashima_: I used to be a friend of Kesper.\a Before he died, that is.
Kresla: Kesper? How-
