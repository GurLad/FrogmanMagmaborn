Xeplogi: Woah! Wh-where are we?
Torment: Huh? What is going on?\a You are not supposed to be here.
Frogman: Here?
Fashima: Your time has come, Torment.\a I am here to destroy you.
Werse: This... What is the meaning of this, Fashima?!
Torment: Destroy... me? HA HA HA! Have you lost your mind, Fashima?!\a I cannot be destroyed! I feed on destruction!\a I AM destruction!\a What foolishness! Heh heh!\a But I do love me a good betryal.\a Please explain this neferious plan of yours!
Fashima: My plan is far from neferious.
Alfred: Ha! You liar! Everything you do is neferious!
Fashima: Shut up, Alfred. Anyway, I have been studying you, Torment.\a Your powers. Your personality. Your past mistakes.\a And most importantly, the previous attempt on your life -\a the joint effort of Xirveros and the Guards to defeat you.
Kresla: Woah, hold on. Xirveros? What's he got to do with this?
Torment: The so-called attempt by the mad wizard himself? Ha ha ha!\a Are you really this desperate, Fashima?
Xirveros: Hm. I do not think desperation is the right description.\a Bold. Foolhardy, perhaps. But not desperate.
Torment: Oh?
Firbell: Xirveros? You... Are you back? Is... is this real?!
Xirveros: Indeed, your highness.\a Torment's power was finally lifted from my mind,\a thanks to Fashima.
Fashima: You're welcome, my friends.\a However, we do not have much time left.\a Torment will recover their powers soon enough.\a We must strike now, while we still have some time left.
Frogman: Time?
Torment: Heh. Oh, wow. Ha ha. HA HA HA!\a I've got to admit, I'm impressed!\a Sealing my powers.\a Breaking into my domain. You've got guts.\a But you forget one thing, Fashima.\a Your magic relies on my power.\a Without me, all Magmaborn will die.\a All the so-called Guards, as well.\a Not to mention your own oh-so-precious spells.
Memerian: Of course there's a catch. Typical.
Werse: ...The Guards... will die?
Kresla: We'll die?!
Alfred: You've murdered enough, Fashima! No more!
Fashima: Calm yourselves, my friends. I-
Memerian: I am not your friend.
Fashima: ...I know that the sacrifice is great, and yet we must make it.\a Torment has been a blight upon humanity for too long.\a Upon you, me, and countless human lives.\a The lives of the few - even our own -\a are not worth the suffering they have caused.\a We must stand united-
Memerian: Nope. I'm out.
Torment: Heh.
Fashima: Excuse me?
Memerian: I'm not dying for no noble cause.\a Especially not for you, Fashima.
Alfred: You will die, Fashima! Not us! We will destroy YOU!
