Torment: Heh heh. Do you feel your bond weakening, Fashima?
Fashima: Do you feel your life force fleeting, Torment?
Torment: A bit of a... personal question, don't you think?
Ha ha! But I'm fine, thanks for asking.
Fashima: Not for long.
:return:
}
Torment: Heh heh. Do you feel your seal weakening, Fashima?
Fashima: I am well aware of it, Torment.\a Worry not, I will be done long before it shatters.
Torment: We'll see. Heh.

Torment: Indeed...

Torment: Heh. You were faster than I anticipated,\a but it won't be enough.\a I'll be free again soon.

Torment: Make it count, then. Heh.

Torment: Ha ha ha! All this blood and death, for a tiny scratch?\a I expected better from you, Fashima. Heh.
Fashima: ...Everything is going according to plan.
Torment: Oh, really? Well then, don't let me interrupt this...\a master plan of yours! Ha ha!
:return:
}
Torment: Ha ha ha! Are you even trying, Fashima?\a To be honest, I'm dissapointed.
Fashima: ...
Torment: No comment, hm? Too busy failing to harm me, are you?\a Heh heh! Well, do go on! Don't let me interrupt you!

Torment: I almost thought you had a chance for a second there.
But your time is running out, Fashima. Heh.
Fashima: ...Worry not, your death is imminent.
Torment: Ooh, imminent? Am I supposed be afraid? Ha ha ha!\a But this is your show, not mine. Heh.\a So please, continue!

Torment: Oh, how disappointing.
I expected you to put up more a fight.
Fashima: ...It's not over yet.
Torment: Seriously? You would need a miracle to pull it off now.\a Heh. But very well, let's see you try!
:return:
}
Torment: Ha ha ha! Oh, this is just precious!
All this effort, and you have nothing to show for it!
Fashima: ...
Torment: Don't give me that look. Heh. You still have a bit of time.\a Better not waste it! Ha ha!
