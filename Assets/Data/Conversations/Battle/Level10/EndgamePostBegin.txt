Xeplogi||L: Woah! Wh-where are we now?
Torment||R: Huh? You are not supposed to be here.\a Neither am I, for that matter.
Fashima||L: I apologise for dragging you here, my friends,\a but I require your help to destroy Torment.
Werse||R: This... What is the meaning of this, Fashima?!
Torment||R: Destroy... me? HA HA HA! Have you lost your mind, Fashima?!\a But I do love me a good betrayal.\a Please explain this nefarious plan of yours!\a Heh heh!
Fashima||L: It is far from complex.\a I have merely reversed your magical seal -\a trapping the Fortress inside of you,\a instead of you inside the Fortress.
Frogman||R: What?
Torment||R: Ooh, very impressive!\a But such magic will surely not last very long.\a Heh.\a How will you... destroy me in that time, hm?
Fashima||L: I have also rendered you quite powerless for that duration,\a which should give my friends enough time to slay you.
Torment||R: Powerless?
Xirveros||L: Hm. Interesting manouvere.
Firbell||L: Xirveros?!
Xirveros||L: Indeed. My mind has returned at last, your highness.
Torment||R: Oh, I see what you mean. Clever move, Fashima. Ha!\a But why would your so-called friends even want to hurt me?\a Considering the consequences, of course.\a Heh heh.
Frogman||L: Consequences?
Fashima||L: ...
Torment||R: Why, without me, there can be no magic.\a No monsters.\a No Guards.\a No... Magmaborn.\a Heh heh!
Memerian||R: Of course there's a catch. Typical.
Werse||R: ...The Guards... will die?
Kresla||R: We'll die?!
Alfred||R: You've murdered enough, Fashima! No more!
:setSpeaker:Torment||R
Fashima||L: ...I am well aware of that.\a And yet, it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.\a We must stand united, my friends, and-
Memerian||R: I'm not your friend.
Fashima||L: ...And rid this world of the evil that is Torment.\a They has been a blight upon humanity for too long.\a Upon you, me, and countless human lives.\a The lives of the few - even our own -\a are not worth the suffering-
