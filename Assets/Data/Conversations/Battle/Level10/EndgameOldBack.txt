# TBA: More intro, improve - this is just a first draft written after midnight
# Show closed door CG
Fashima: This is it. The door to Lessy's chamber, and the way outside.\a Are you ready to get out of here, my friend?
Frogman: Yes.
Fashima: Excellent. Let us enter, then.
:screenShake:
# Show empty room CG
Frogman: ...Huh? What's with the huge crystal?\a And where is Lessy?
Fashima: That is our prison. And Lessy is already dead.
Frogman: Wait, what?
Fashima: I killed her back when I was still alive.\a You'll understand soon enough.\a In the meantime, I need to-
Werse: Stop right there.
Frogman: H-huh? Who was that?\a Where did you come from?
Fashima: Hmpf. Stay out of this, Werse.
Werse: Fashima. I always did loathe you, you know.\a But betraying the Guards?\a Joining the Magmaborn?\a Have you no shame?
Fashima: The feeling is mutual.\a Still, I do not have time for you.\a Begone.
Werse: How dare-
:screenShake:
Ugh!
Fashima: Good riddance.
Werse: Don't... Don't do this... Fashima...
Fashima: Too late.

Torment: Oh, this is so exhilirating! Don't you agree, Fashima?\a My true champion? Heh heh heh!
Fashima: Definitely, master. But you should thank all the Magmaborn, properly.\a They were the ones who ultimately let you out,\a not me.
Frogman: Wait, master?
Torment: You are correct, my champion!\a With my newfound power, it should take but a moment!

Torment: HA HA HA! Oh, this is simply marvelous!\a We should celebrate! By KILLING EVERYONE! Ha ha ha!\a Don't you agree, Fashima?\a Hey, why are you sulking near the dusty old crystal, anyway?
Fashima: Oh, you will see. Just a few more second, and...
Torment: And what? Wait, what are you-
:screenShake:
# Fade. Slowly reveal endgame area
Torment: What... What is going on?\a Fashima?\a What have you done?!
