Bodder: You there. Green face. Are you the one?
Frogman: Excuse me?
Bodder: The murderer. The sociopath. The savage.\a The one who has slain countless Guards in his\a first life. You are him, are you not?
Frogman: I usually go by Frogman.
Bodder: Frogman. A fitting name for a monstrosity such as you.
Do you know what I hate most in this world?
Frogman: Uh... no.
Bodder: Monsters such as yourself.\a Ones who do not think twice before killing people.
Who care for nothing but their own flesh.
Frogman: Okay.
Bodder: But your massacre ends here, Frogman. And do you know why?
Frogman: Oh, just shut up and fight already.
Bodder: Because-

Bodder: Frogman, Frogman, Frogman.
Do you know how long have I been waiting for this moment?
Frogman: Uh... no.
Bodder: Ever since you've slain your first Guard,\a all those months ago.
Frogman: Are you sure it was mon-
Bodder: And do you know why, Frogman?
Frogman: Because you seek revenge?
Bodder: Because I'm the guardian of the Guards, Frogman.\a I raised them.\a I trained them.\a I taught them all they know.
Frogman: Okay.
Bodder: And do you know what you are, Frogman?
Frogman: Enlighten me.
Bodder: A hideous, nefarious, bloodthirsty monster.
One which doesn't think twice before killing people.
One which cares for nothing but its own flesh.
Frogman: When will this monologue end, Bodder?
Bodder: And do you know what I hate most in this world, Frogman?
Frogman: Silence?
Bodder: Monsters like you, Frogman.
Frogman: I've had enough. Let's charge, everyone!
Bodder: And do you know-

Bodder: And just like that, the murderer returns.
Frogman: Ugh. Can we skip this pointless conversation,\a and get to the fighting already?
Bodder: Do you know what makes one a monster such as you, Frogman?
Frogman: I truly couldn't care less.
Bodder: The lack of care for other's well-being.\a The missing desire to talk and interact.
The careless disregard for human life.
Frogman: Do you know what I'd like to do most right now, Bodder?
Bodder: Do you know what I think you'd like to do right now, Frogman?
Frogman: What?
Bodder: What?
Frogman: ...You know what? Never mind. Let's go, everyone!
Bodder: What?

Bodder: Frogman, Frogman, Frogman.
Are you truly incapable of learning?
Frogman: No, I'm not doing this again. Let's go!
