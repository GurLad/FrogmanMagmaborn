Bodder: Frogman, Frogman, Frogman.
Do you know how long have I been waiting for this moment?
Frogman: Uh... no.
Bodder: Ever since you've slain your first Guard,\a all those months ago.
Frogman: Are you sure it was mon-

Frogman: What?
Bodder: What?
Frogman: ...You know what? Never mind. Let's go, everyone!
Bodder: What?

Bodder: Frogman, Frogman, Frogman.
Are you truly incapable of learning?
Frogman: No, I'm not doing this again. Let's go!
