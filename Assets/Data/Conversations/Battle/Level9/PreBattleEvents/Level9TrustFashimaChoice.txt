Frogman||L: I don't think so.
Fashima: Excuse me?
Frogman: You really don't seem trustworthy.
I'd rather take my chances trying to get out of here\a alone than work with you.
Fashima: Are you sure about that?
Frogman: Yes.
Fashima: That is a very foolish choice.\a Need I remind you that your life,\a and that of your companions, lies in my hands?
Frogman: Is that a threat?
Fashima: Indeed.\a Now, stop acting like an idiot and let's go.
Frogman: ...

Frogman||L: I do not respond well to threats.
Fashima: Is that so?\a Are you aware of\a what happens when a Magmaborn stays alive for over a week?
Frogman: Uh... no.
Fashima: They start slowly rotting away.
A countermeasure devised by Torment to prevent the Magi\a from simply locking you up forever.
It is quite the painful death,\a judging by Xirveros' screams from when I tried that on him.
Frogman: You... you're lying!\a You wouldn't do that!
Fashima: Do not presume to tell me what I will and will not do.\a See you next life, Frogman.
I hope that you will come to your senses by then.

Frogman: W-wait! Come back here!\a You can't-
...There's got to be a door here somewhere!

...I guess she just always teleports inside and out, huh?\a Time to break down the walls, then!
:screenShake:
Argh!
:screenShake:
Nrgh!
:screenShake:
Oof!\a What are these walls made of?!\a They're not even budging!
...
I-it can't end like this... right?\a Help!\a Someone!\a Please!\a I'm stuck here! HELP!
...
She... s-she's coming back, right?
S-she can't be serious...
This is... too much...
