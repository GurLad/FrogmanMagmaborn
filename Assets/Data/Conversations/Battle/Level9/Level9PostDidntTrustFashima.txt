Fashima||R: You idiot.
Frogman: You monster! What you've done to me was...\a It was inhumane!
Fashima: That's what you get for questioning me, Frogman.\a Let this be a lesson to you.\a Do not disobey me again.
Frogman: Disobey you? I'm not your servant!
Fashima: Of course you are. You always have been.
Frogman: I-
:screenShake:
Yahh!
...Huh?
Fashima: Pathetic. Was that your attempt at an attack?\a Really now. That was extraordinarily foolish,\a even for you.
Frogman: You...
Fashima: Listen. I grow weary of your antics.\a You do not understand what's at stake here.\a Do what I say and stay out of my way.\a That is your only role from now on.\a Get it?
Frogman: ...
Fashima: I will not hesitate to torture and kill you again,\a but that would be a blatant waste of time,\a don't you agree?\a Do not make this difficult, Frogman.\a For your own safety.
Frogman: ...First Torment, now you...\a Am I truly doomed to be your plaything forever?
Fashima: No. Help us get out of here,\a and I shall let you go.\a I will have no further need for you afterwards.
Frogman: ...
Fashima: Cease this pointless pouting, please.\a It is getting boring,\a and we've got a Magus to slay today.
Frogman: ...Fine. Let's go, then.
Fashima: Good boy.
