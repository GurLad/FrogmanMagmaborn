Frogman: We've won! Yay!
:play:ToriTheme
:loadMap:EndOfBeta
Torment|Dev: Correct! And now, you've reached the end of the beta!\a The final boss is supposed to be up next.\a However, as it's not ready yet,\a you'll simply die!\a Heh heh heh!
The story will assume you've lost to Bodder,\a but you can continue playing to find more\a conversations and upgrades and stuff.
Frogman: Speaking of conversations,\a have some random trivia about all your characters!
Mostly to incentivise you replaying the beta.
Anyway, I was originally the protagonist of a 3D top-down\a action-puzzle game made for a game jam.\a Torment was the antagonist in it as well,
but was called The Blue Fireball of Torment there.
:if:hasCharacter:Firbell{
Firbell: I was supposed to become a total psycho during battles,\a who enjoyed blood, death and destruction.\a However, since pretty much all the other\a Magmaborn ended up being various shades of evil,
that element of my character was scrapped.
}
:if:hasCharacter:Xirveros{
Xirveros: I was heavily inspired by Tryggvi from The Banner Saga -\a Gur's favourite game.
My songs were supposed to foreshadow important events,\a just like Tryggvi's.\a Speaking of foreshadowing -\a what do you think happened to Lessy?
}
:if:hasCharacter:Kresla{
Kresla: Originally, you were supposed to be able to get both me and\a Firbell in the same run.\a However, that created too many conversations variants,
and so the "Firbell avoids me" plotline was invented.
In short, Firbell hates me just because Gur got lazy.\a Oof!
}
:if:hasCharacter:Xeplogi{
Xeplogi: I changed a lot during development -\a almost as much as Fashima!\a I was, at various stages of development: female,\a named Kepluigi, an actor, a self-proclaimed hero,\a and an amnesic.\a I even had my portrait redrawn from scratch\a at one point!\a Gur had a hard time writing every single one\a of my iterations -\a including the final one.
Which is why I have so little dialogue in the game.\a Oh ho ho!
}
:if:hasCharacter:Memerian{
Memerian: I was pretty much constant during development,\a unlike Xeplogi.
Also, Gur picks me every single time when playing.
All the later maps were designed around me -
Xeplogi is the challenge/joke option by design.\a Take that, Xeplogi!
}
:if:hadCharacter:Alfred{
Alfred: I was originally an insufferable, annoying creep.\a But Gur had a hard time writing that,\a so I was changed to an insufferable,\a annoying edgelord.\a See a difference? I don't.
Frogman: Hey, aren't you dead?
Alfred: Shush.
}
:if:hasCharacter:Fashima{
Fashima: I was actually one of the very first characters conceived.\a But I changed a ton during development -\a my name, gender, age, personality, design,\a and even story role were all changed,\a some even multiple times!\a My final name is a reference to Gur's friend,\a who called himself Fashima in Among Us and was the impostor\a every single time.
}
Torment|Dev: And that was it!\a Please send me any and all feedback!\a I hope you liked the beta!\a Bye now!
