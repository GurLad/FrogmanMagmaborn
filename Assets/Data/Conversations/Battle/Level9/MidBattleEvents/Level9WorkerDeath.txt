Firbell: Frogman? What have you just done?!
Frogman: Uh... Killed an enemy?
Firbell: That was a harmless, unharmed person!\a They were not our enemy, Bodder is our enemy!\a Why did you do this?
Frogman: Um...
Firbell: This was completely unjustified!\a You disgust me! Prepare to die!
Frogman: Woah, hey now. No need to get aggressive.
Firbell: No need to get aggressive?
You just killed a person for no reason whatsoever,\a and you're calling me aggressive?!\a Ugh! I have had enough of you!

Frogman: Oops.

:if:hasCharacter:Xeplogi{
Xeplogi: How utterly detestable!\a Killing an innocent bystander is quite unbeffiting a person\a such as yourself, Frogman!
Frogman: Well...
Xeplogi: Truly, have you no shame? That was simply monstrous!
Frogman: I mean, they're still our enemy...
Xeplogi: Enough!
The Duke of Jess cannot be seen aiding a murderer.
Please do not take this personally, Frogman.

Frogman: Wait, hold on. Are you defecting?
Xeplogi: Indeed. Prepare to face justice, evildoer!
Frogman: Seriously?

:if:hasCharacter:Kresla{
Kresla: Woah. Did you just kill a random onlooker?
Frogman: Uh... yes?
Kresla: Wow! That's hardcore! Why did you do that, though?
Frogman: To... anger Bodder?
Kresla: You killed a person just to anger Bodder?\a I've got to admit,\a I didn't see that coming. Interesting!\a You've got quite the dark mind!
Frogman: Thanks...?

Memerian: Heh. You're brutal. I like it.
Frogman: I'm... glad to hear that?
