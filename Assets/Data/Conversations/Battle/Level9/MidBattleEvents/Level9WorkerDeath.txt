Firbell: Frogman? What have you just done?!
Frogman: Uh... Killed an enemy?
Firbell: That was a harmless, unharmed person!\a They were not our enemy, Bodder is our enemy!\a Why did you do this?
Frogman: Um...
Firbell: This was completely unjustified!\a You disgust me! Prepare to die!
Frogman: Woah, hey now. No need to get aggresive.
Firbell: No need to get aggressive?
You just killed a person for no reason whatsoever,\a and you're calling me aggressive?!\a Ugh! I have had enough of you!
:setTeam:Firbell:guard
Frogman: Oops.

Kresla: Woah. Did you just kill a random onlooker?
Frogman: Uh... yes?
Kresla: Wow! That's brutal! Why did you do that, though?
Frogman: To... anger Bodder?
Kresla: You killed a person just to anger Bodder?\a I've got to admit,\a I didn't see that coming. Interesting!\a You've got quite the dark mind!
Frogman: Thanks...?
