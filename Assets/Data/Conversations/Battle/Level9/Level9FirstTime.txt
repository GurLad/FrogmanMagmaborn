Wait, where is everyone?!
Fashima: Don't worry, my friend. They are safe.
Frogman: Safe where? What have you done to them?!
Fashima: I have merely teleported them somewhere else.\a Our talk might tread treacherous ground.
Frogman: Teleported? How?

Fashima: Teleportation crystals.
Frogman: What?
Fashima: Crystals enchanted to teleport people here when touched.\a That's why I threw them at you, my friend.
Frogman: But how did you touch them then?
Fashima: A wonderful invention called gloves.
Frogman: I... see.
Fashima: We have some time to rest now, my friend.\a If you wish, you can ask me more questions.\a If not, we can move on to our next target.
Frogman: Next target?
Fashima: Your goal is to get out of here. Correct?
Frogman: Uh, yes?
Fashima: Great. Then we have two more Magi standing in our way:\a Bodder and Lessy.
:if:hasFlag:FrogmanKnowsWhatTheMagiAre{
Frogman: Wait. Weren't you a Magus yourself?\a Why are you helping us?\a Why are you fighting the other Magi?

:else:{
Frogman: Magi? What does that mean?
Fashima: The leaders of the Guards, capable of using magic.
Frogman: Like you?
Fashima: Exactly.
Frogman: Oh. Then why are you helping us?\a Why are you fighting the other Magi?
}
Fashima: Please keep your questions for the end, my friend.
Frogman: Okay...
Fashima: Our next target is Bodder, the Clone Magus.\a I shall teleport us to him once you're ready.
Frogman: Sure...
Fashima: Now. Do you have any further questions for me?
:showBase:
# TBA: Add the "don't trust Fashima" choice.
Frogman: I think that's enough questions.
Fashima: Great. Then let's go to Bodder.

Bodder: Frogman, Frogman, Frogman.
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?
Frogman: Uh... no.
Bodder: Ever since you've slain your first Guard,\a all those months ago.
Frogman: Are you sure it was mon-
Bodder: And do you know why, Frogman?
Frogman: Because you seek revenge?
Bodder: Because I'm the guardian of the Guards, Frogman.\a I raised them.\a I trained them.\a I taught them all they know.
Frogman: Okay.
Bodder: And do you know what you are, Frogman?
Frogman: Enlighten me.
Bodder: A hideous, nefarious, bloodthirsty monster.
One which doesn't think twice before killing people.
One which cares for nothing but its own flesh.
Frogman: When will this monologue end, Bodder?
Bodder: And do you know what I hate most in this world, Frogman?
Frogman: Silence?
Bodder: Monsters like you, Frogman.
Frogman: I've had enough. Let's charge, everyone!
Bodder: And do you know-

Bodder: This... This isn't even... my final...
