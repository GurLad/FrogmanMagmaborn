Torment: Hello, hello!
Frogman: You again...\a I've heard someone mention Tori.\a Is that you?
Torment: Oh, so you've finally met Xeplogi!\a He's a hilarious one, don't you think? Ha ha ha!
Frogman: Annoying is more accurate...
Torment: What's the difference? Heh heh!\a I've made him that way, you know.\a I keep resetting his mind.
Frogman: What?
:play:Trickster:T
Torment: Yes, yes! That's the only way he keeps his story straight,\a heh heh! And it's just so funny!\a Especially your reactions, ha!
Frogman: So that's why each time I meet him,\a he repeats the same story and can't remember me?

Torment: Oh, you're so naive! Heh heh!\a It takes a lot of energy to reset him each time,\a but your subsequent suffering is always\a worth it!
Frogman: Sure. Can we leave now?
Torment: Fine, go ahead.\a Oh, and betray him if you can!
He's so very hurt each time, it's incredible! Ha ha ha!
