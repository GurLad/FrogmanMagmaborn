Frogman: What? No, we're fellow Magmaborn.
Xeplogi: What?

Firbell: ...Very well. I will trust you on this.\a But these humans... Why are we fighting them?
Frogman: They attacked us.
Firbell: Still. These are no mindless monsters.\a They are sentient beings.\a Are we doing the right thing?
Frogman: ...We have no other choice.
Firbell: No, we could-
Frogman: We should get out of here soon, Firbell.\a Will you help us fight?
Firbell: I-\a This...\a Very well, Frogman.\a Lead the way.
