Xeplogi: Hold!\a Where do you come from, monster friends?\a Are you Tori minions sent to serve me?
Frogman: What? No, we're fellow Magmaborn.
Xeplogi: What?
Frogman: When you died, you had a crystal with you - an emblem,\a you might say, correct?
Xeplogi: Are you talking about the holy Tori relic?
Frogman: Yes, whatever. Anyway, this allowed you to be reborn as a-
Xeplogi: And serve the glorious Tori in his holy crusade against\a Memerian!
Frogman: I- you know what, never mind.\a Yes, we're Tori followers.\a Happy now?

Firbell: Frogman.
Frogman: Yes?
Firbell: Are you sure that siding with this lunatic is a good idea?
Frogman: He's a Magmaborn, like us.\a We should all help each other,\a regardless of our conditions.
Firbell: ...Very well. I will trust you on this.\a But these humans... Why are we fighting them?
Frogman: They attacked us.\a Do we need another reason?
Firbell: Yet they are sentinet beings, like us.\a Should we not join forces, as you yourself said?
Frogman: Xeplogi didn't attack us.
Firbell: We do appear as monsters.
What if they were sent here by Irenhold?\a We must inform them I am here.
Frogman: So this is what it's all about, eh?
Firbell: It would be dishonorable to fight without a formal-
Frogman: No, I get it. We'll try talking to them then.\a But I doubt they'll listen.
Firbell: Very well. Thank you, Frogman.
