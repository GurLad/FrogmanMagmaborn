Kresla: Hey there, Xirveros!
Xirveros: Kresla!\a You build goblin pyramid?
Frogman: What?
Kresla: I have no idea.
Xirveros: Pyramid of doom! Of frogs!
Kresla: Go on.
Xirveros: Take forty two frogs. Put on thirty seven goblins.\a Then pour magma!
Frogman: ...What?
Kresla: Sure, I'll try that.\a Except we only have one frog.
Frogman: Wait, are you talking about me?
Kresla: Who else?\a Maybe we can split you into forty two parts,\a then find the goblins, and-
Frogman: Kresla, what is wrong with you?!
:loadUnits:
Xirveros: Yes! For split frog, need eighty goblins,\a not thiry seven!
Kresla: Really? I'll try to remember that.
Frogman: You're all mad.\a Speaking of goblins,\a did you notice the monsters here?
Xirveros: Monsters?! Are there goblins?
Frogman: This is irrelevant! We need to fight!
