FrogmanMan|Frogman: Whew, we're safe.
Zip: Yes, that was quite a run, boss.
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Yep. But we've finally lost them.
Zip: I still don't know how you do it, boss.
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Which part? Infiltrating the most well-guarded castle in\a the region, stealing all the valuables,\a or getting away with it?
Zip: Ha! Ever the humble one, eh?
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Heh. Well, enough with the pleasnetries.\a Status report.
Zip: Let me see... We have seven silver plates, thirteen forks-
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Skip the trinkets for now. Highlights?
Zip: Right. Three Abezy paintings.
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Abezy? Where did the lord get them?
Zip: Don't know, boss.
FrogmanMan|Frogman: They're probably fake. Next?
Zip: Uh... There's the diamond necklace we found.
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Right, that one. I don't think the diamonds are real,\a but we can try selling it to another lordling anyway.
Zip: Probably. What else... Ah, the muskets.
FrogmanMan|Frogman: We never found the gunpowder and bullets, did we?
Zip: No, boss. Frankly, I don't think he had any.\a Probably only kept them to impress guests.
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Yes. Too bad. They're useless then.
Zip: We might find someone willing-
FrogmanMan|Frogman: Too risky.\a Well, it's still a good haul.\a Let's go back.
Zip: Sure thing, boss.
