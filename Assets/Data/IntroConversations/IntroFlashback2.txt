Zip: Frogman. She's here.
FrogmanMan: Already? Oh well, nothing to be done about it.\a Let her in.
Zip: I don't like her, boss. It smells like a trap.
FrogmanMan: I know. But she is alone, and she's foreign -\a she only arrived in the city yesterday.
Zip: Still, I don't think it's wise.\a She asked specifically for you, boss.\a These are always trouble.
FrogmanMan: Relax, Zip. We're well known as the best thieves in the\a region for a reason.
We shouldn't fear some upstart from Straberod,\a even if she's probably going to try killing\a me.
Zip: ...\a You're the boss, boss.\a I'll let her in.
DeharFB||L: Hello, Frogman. Thank you for having an audience with me.
FrogmanMan: Greetings, Kebera. Please, have a seat.
DeharFB: Thank you.
FrogmanMan: This is my collegue, Zip.
Zip||R: ...
FrogmanMan||R: I hope you do not mind having him here.\a Treat him as my shadow.
DeharFB: I see.
FrogmanMan: So. Let's get to business. What do you want?
DeharFB: Let me start from the beginning. My name is-
FrogmanMan: I know who you are. Your request?
DeharFB: I'll be blunt then.
I was sent here on behalf of the governor of Straberod.\a She offers you a mission.
FrogmanMan: Which is?
DeharFB: Unfortunately, I cannot disclose it to anyone but you,\a Frogman.\a Those are my instructions.
FrogmanMan: Unacceptable. Zip will hear everything I will.
DeharFB: She is willing to pay quite handsomely for this, Frogman.
FrogmanMan: I don't care. It's both of us, or nothing.
DeharFB: ...Is there any way to change your mind?
FrogmanMan: No.\a If that is all, I think we're done here.\a Zip, show her out.
DeharFB: There is no need, Frogman.\a Thank you for your hospitality.
Zip||L: ...
I told you she's trouble.
FrogmanMan: You were right. She was testing us.\a Me.\a Let's tail her. Ready to go?
Zip: Always, boss.
